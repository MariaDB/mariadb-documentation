I was looking for a query that would return a single row for Batting and Fielding stats for a specific 'playerID'. I don't know how to insert that specific 'playerID' into the query to filter out the other 100,000+ playerIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

In this case, you have a comma after &lt;code&gt;from Batting&lt;/code&gt; which shouldn't be there. See &lt;a href="/kb/en/joining-tables-with-join-clauses/"&gt;Joining Tables with JOIN Clauses&lt;/a&gt; for more examples.&lt;/p&gt;
