&lt;p&gt;I don't know the maximum off-hand (1024?), but as I recall, compound indices require a space equal to the sum of the maximum length of each column in the index, plus some bytes of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I know it's a query I'm going to do often, I avoid "covering indexes" because complex ones can quickly eat up the max index length, in which case, some of the columns (in longest order?) get quietly truncated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, truncated columns in the compound index could easily blow away any advantage there was to a covering index! In a large database (say, the New York City phone book), it would have to do a table scan of all the truncated columns, right?&lt;/p&gt;
