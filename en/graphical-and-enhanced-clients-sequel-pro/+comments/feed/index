&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few things that it falls short in, notably editing Views. For that, I use Querious, which has a nice interface for editing Views, and also can draw a "bubbles and lines" structure graph of your database, including foreign key links. But for data entry work, I find the Querious interface less useful that Sequel Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area I have trouble with using Sequel Pro is editing SETs. I can't find any combination of modifier keys that will allow me to select multiple values from the pre-defined drop-down menu! Querious does this handily, using the usual Command and Shift modifier keys to select multiple values in a drop-down list.&lt;/p&gt;
