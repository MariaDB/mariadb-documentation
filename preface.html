<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>If you’re contemplating whether to devote some time to this book, read this:</p>
<ul>
<li>MariaDB Server is a general-purpose, open source, relational database management system, optimised for performance and easy usabiility; it has its roots in MySQL Server, and is an alternative to Postgres, Oracle Database and other relational and NoSQL databases</li>
<li>This book is the full documentation on MariaDB Server, a “Reference Manual Plus” which includes aspects of a User’s Guide; it is based on the contents of the MariaDB Knowledge base (<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/">https://mariadb.com/kb/</a>), an open, community-edited site contributed to since the inception of MariaDB in 2009</li>
<li>This edition is not specific to any version of MariaDB Server, but includes functionality up to the latest version of MariaDB at the time of generation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This preface describes the goals, structure and contents of the documentation. Reading it is intended as a helpful step in understanding how to best use the manual to improve productivity in using MariaDB Server.
</p>
<h3>This Book’s “Prehistory”</h3>
<p>
As noted, MariaDB Server has its roots in MySQL Server. It started as a fork of MySQL Server, using the same GPLv2 license. However, although the MySQL Server documentation was always publicly available, it was never released using a free documentation license. This means that the documentation of MariaDB Server was created from scratch. Or rather, from the online help texts, which had a compatible open licence that made them usable as a starting point.
</p>
<p>
The place to which documentation was written was labelled the “Knowledge Base”, by MySQL and MariaDB creator Michael “Monty” Widenius. The Knowledge Base was – and remains – a community effort. As with many community efforts, there are core contributors around whom the work is centered. This is where Daniel Bartholomew loaded the online help text, as a first seed. For roughly the last ten years, the core editor of the MariaDB Knowledge Base has been Ian Gilfillan, working for MariaDB Foundation and based in South Africa. Hence, his name is on the cover of the book. However, there are a large number of other contributors, many of whom come from MariaDB Corporation – both as developers of code and as documentation writers. They are listed on <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/stats/users/">https://mariadb.com/kb/stats/users/</a>.
</p>
<p>
With now some 3000 pages in this book, most of the initial holes in the documentation have been filled. There should now be no reason to do as in the very early days of MariaDB Server – namely look up MariaDB features in the MySQL documentation. On the contrary, the functionality of the two databases have diverged considerably, so you would be ill advised not to use this MariaDB Server specific documentation.
</p>
    
<h3>The First Edition</h3>
<p>
The first edition of the MariaDB Server Documentation as a PDF file was released in April 2022. Prior to this, the contents were accessible as individual Knowledge Base (KB) articles. But already in 2014 – over seven years before – the user base requested a PDF version, as seen by MariaDB’s Jira entry <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6881">https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6881</a> MariaDB Documentation improvements. There, user Stoykov pointed out that MariaDB documentation already had search capabilities and a way to mirror the KB in an offline version – but lacked downloadable PDF and EPUB versions,
</p>
<p>
Fast forward some seven years and a number of upvotes and watchers, we decided to devote resources to it. Creating a PDF from an HTML file is something Python is good at, and Dorje Gilfillan did all the tweaking necessary to merge the individual KB pages into one huge HTML file for PDF conversion.
</p>
<h3>This Book’s Structure</h3>

<p>We had to impose a chapter structure on the book which is only indirectly visible from a collection of KB articles on the web. This means that the work in compiling the PDF isn’t just about merging many KB pages in an order that could be derived from the hierarchical pointers between the articles. It also involves cleaning up that structure.</p>

<p>As a result, you will see two tables of contents. One is a one-pager overview with just the two top levels of hierarchy. The other is over 30 pages long. True to the Open Source mantra of “release early, release often”, we believe that the structure can still be improved upon – but it is a good starting point. We have seven overall chapters, and the structures below them all make sense at some level.</p>

<p>To get the most out of the book, we recommend you to spend time making yourself familiar with the table of contents. It will give you an idea of existing functionality. Just browsing it through may give you ideas of commands you didn't know existed.</p>

<h3>This Book’s Format</h3>

<p>There is currently just one version of the book. It’s delivered in the PDF format, and in the Golden Ratio aspect ratio – meaning, A4. As we envision it to be read mostly on-screen anyway, we wanted to avoid the additional complexity of also providing a US Letter format. If we meet demand for further versions, doing US Letter is of course an option; however, given there are many ways to improve the documentation, we would also like to understand how adding another aspect ratio of the PDF would benefit the users in practice.</p>

<p>We don’t yet provide the ePub format. Again, if you desire ePub, please educate us as to what added benefits you expect of ePub on top of PDF.</p>

<h3>Use Cases For This Book</h3>

<p>We expect the main use case for the PDF version of the book to be offline access. Offline may be imposed by a flaky or non-existent internet, but also by self-imposed abstinence from the many distractions of being online.</p>

<p>We expect that browsing the PDF will enable concentrated time to be spent on learning about MariaDB Server. The search functionality of PDF browsers helps in finding out about commands and syntax you already know of; browsing through a PDF – in particular the clickable Table of Contents – will hopefully provide you with an educational overview better than the online KB does.</p>

<p>We expect downloading the manual into laptops, tablets and phones will make sense. If you have the MariaDB Server Documentation on your phone, you can turn waiting time into something productive, perhaps even fun.</p>

<h3>What we should work on</h3>

<p>We have lots of room for improvement. That said, our foremost goal now is to get the book out, to get it used. User feedback will help us determine the right priority for our already existing ideas for improvements. We will likely get other requests beyond what we currently have in mind.</p>

<p>In the area of basic usability, an index has been spoken about. Looking up commands through searches or through browsing the table of contents is ok, but an index also has use cases. Our plan here starts from automatic indexing based on keywords of the headers of individual articles.</p>

<p>In the area of layout, we are looking at finding icons that make the PDF look more like a book, and less like a web page. We already solved the first issue, which was to find a clearer visual distinction between links within the PDF and links to the web.</p>

<p>In the area of structure, the length of individual chapters varies a lot. It may make sense to move around chapters in the TOC tree, to be more balanced. It may be that the reader expects another ordering based on experiences from other databases. It may even be that we lack entire topics. For instance, we eliminated the Release Notes for unsupported versions of MariaDB, even though these are still accessible on the KB.</p>

<p>In the area of accessibility, there may be places we should publish the PDF to make it easier to find, download, and use.</p>

<p>The common denominator for all of the above is that we need your feedback on what makes sense for you as a user of MariaDB Server.</p>

<h3>Give Us Feedback</h3>

<p>We would like to pick the brains of individual users. At conferences, asking open-ended questions is easy and feels productive for both parties, when meeting in the corridors between talks. Replicating the same productive discussion on-line is much harder. It takes effort from both parties. It feels like work.</p>

<p>We are still looking for the best way for you to give us meaningful feedback. Feel free to approach us over Zulip (<a href="https://mariadb.zulipchat.com/">https://mariadb.zulipchat.com/</a> – the Documentation topic). Also email to foundation@mariadb.org will find its way to us.</p>

<p>When you find individual bugs, please enter them into Jira using the guidelines mentioned in the KB article <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-documentation-bugs/">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-documentation-bugs/</a>.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>Compiling any book requires more effort than expected by the authors, and more than visible to the readers. This book is no exception. It has been over ten years in the making.</p>

<p>The primary thanks go to Ian Gilfillan, as the overall editor of the book and as the individually most productive author.</p>

<p>Close to Ian, we have Daniel Bartholomew. Daniel even beats Ian when it comes to articles created, and comes second on articles edited.</p>

<p>Among the community contributors, we want to highlight Federico Razzoli. He has two accounts, totalling 4488, at the time of writing – making him rank third amongst personal contributors.</p>

<p>When it comes to organisational contributors, the largest one is MariaDB Corporation. With them coding most of the features, they also stand for the lion’s share of their documentation. As writers, besides Daniel Bartholomew whom we already mentioned several times, we want to highlight Russell Dyer, Kenneth Dyer, Geoff Montee, and Jacob Moorman.</p>

<p>As the developer of the KB software itself, Bryan Alsdorf deserves special acknowledgement.</p>

<p>A special  thanks goes to Michael “Monty” Widenius, the creator of MariaDB. Monty has always understood the importance of documentation. He is leading by example, with a large number of personal edits. In fact, Monty has the second highest number of edits amongst developers, after Sergei Golubchik and followed by Sergey Petrunia – all of which have over a thousand edits.</p>

<p>Amongst the prolific contributors within the MariaDB Corporation Engineering team, the Connectors team stands out, with Diego Dupin, Georg Richter, and Lawrin Novitzky ranking near the top. However, we have decided not to include Connectors documentation in this first edition; we are contemplating whether it should be a separate PDF manual.</p>

<p>Other past and present Engineering team members, in decreasing order of number of edits, are David Hill, Dipti Joshi, David Thompson, Massimiliano Pinto, Kolbe Kegel, Vladislav Vaintroub, Ralf Gebhardt, Markus Mäkelä, Sunanda Menon, the late Rasmus Johansson, Todd Stoffel, Elena Stepanova, Julien Fritsch, and Alexander Barkov. They all have more than one hundred edits, which is a lot.</p>

<p>As a true Open Source project, MariaDB Server documentation attracts attention and plentiful contributions also from outside the MariaDB Corporation Documentation and Engineering teams. We want to highlight those with over a hundred edits: Colin Charles and Stephane Varoqui, both of MariaDB Corporation, and Daniel Black, of MariaDB Foundation.</p>

<p>Amongst community contributors in the over-a-hundred-edits category, we want to mention especially Alena Subotina, with edits related to the dbforge documentation tool, and Juan Telleria, with edits often related to R Statistical Programming. Prolific contributors whose contributions are not visible in this English manual are Esper Ecyan (Japanese) and Hector Stredel (French); Federico Razzoli (Italian) has many edits also in English.</p>

<p>We also want to extend a thank you to the code developers who make work easy for the documentation team through thoroughly prepared, reusable texts in Jira; in this category, Marko Mäkelä and Oleksandr Byelkin come to mind.</p>

<p>As for the PDF manual, it has been teamwork between Ian and his son Dorje Gilfillan. Ian has done what editors do, Dorje has coded the Python code that compiles the KB pages into one.</p>

<p>All in all, thank you to everyone who has contributed to this book! We hope compiling it into one volume is of use for you, and we would love to hear what you think about the end result.</p>

<p>Munich, Germany, October 2022</p>

<p>Kaj Arnö, CEO, MariaDB Foundation</p>
