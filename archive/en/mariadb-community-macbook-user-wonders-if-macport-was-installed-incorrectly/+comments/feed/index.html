If it got as far as installing a launchd script, then you could end up with two copies of MariaDB running, competing for the same default port (3306).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the Homebrew folks recommend uninstalling other package managers before installing Homebrew, as sometimes they fight over the $PATH variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first do something like "port uninstall mariadb" (but look it up, I don't have it installed, so I can't tell you how it works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then use the MacPorts procedure for uninstalling itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then install Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do "brew install mariadb". That should give you &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-10117-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.1.17&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Package managers are a joy when they work right, and a royal PITA otherwise...&lt;/p&gt;

We'll give that a try. Do we need to uninstall what macports has done?&lt;/p&gt;

I struggled with it for a while, and it was always out-of-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebrew installation works well for me on a variety of Macs back to 10.6.8. The "formula" seems to be kept up-to-date better than the MacPorts. There's even a nice GUI called "Cakebrew."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 10.5 is too old, considering 10.12 is the current release? Can she upgrade her MacBook?&lt;/p&gt;
