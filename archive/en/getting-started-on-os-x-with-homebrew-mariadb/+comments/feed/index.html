Thinking back through my effort, I realized I didn't really know that MariaDB was a fork of MySql and not just a wrapper for it.  I had actually installed both MySql and MariaDB and there's no telling what damage that did.  So I did a full restart of Homebrew (because those were my first two installs) and all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I found the latest script in TILDE/Library/LaunchAgents. If you're running it multi-user, and want it to start whenever you boot, you need it in /Library/LaunchDaemens, with no leading tilde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish this KnowledgeBase wouldn't fart with what I type in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Do character entities work? Testing tilde: &amp;amp;#126;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They keep changing the damn launch script. It used to be /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.mariadb.plist, but now it appears to be /Library/LaunchDaemons/tigerbrew.mistydemeo.mariadb.plist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also keep farting with putting it is System space or User space. I think the last time I installed, it put it in /Library/LaunchDaemons. (Ugh. Why put the start-up for a multi-user database in a User's Library?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I upgraded via homebrew, I think I had to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;cd /Library/LaunchAgents
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;su
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cp tigerbrew.mistydemeo.mariadb.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cd /Library/LaunchDaemons
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;launchctl load tigerbrew.mistydemeo.mariadb.plist
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;exit
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't take my word for it! Understand where the new script is, and where you want it to be, and what you have to do to get it to run at system boot â€” if that is your intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the Homebrew would figure this out and remain consistent!&lt;/p&gt;
