We are now porting &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-10312-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.3.12&lt;/a&gt; on AIX (7.1 &amp;amp; 7.2).
This requires to improve the existing port of CMake to AIX. Version 3.14.0 for now. This is nearly done. Now using it with MariaDB (and making changes inside MariaDB CMake files).
Build of MariaDB (with old CMake) is OK and there are for now only 76 failed tests  on AIX 7.2 (pass:2446, disabled&amp;amp;skipped:1770) . However, there is still a lot of work to be done, since many tests are not yet run, and plugins may miss. 
Once ported, MariaDB will be available as RPMs on the BullFreeware web-site. And then on the IBM "AIX ToolBox" web-site.
We cannot port it on AIX 6.1 since openat() routine is missing.
Regards,
Tony&lt;/p&gt;

Have you actually tried?
We are running several mysql 5.1 servers on AIX-7.1 (5.1 is the latest version where you can get a binary). For various reasons, we would be very much interested in moving to MariaDB, any build for AIX-5.3 would be good. &lt;/p&gt;

There is a reason I said AIX 5.3 TL7+ and not just AIX 5.3. That would be less important now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) the IBM xlC (aka VAC) compiler can be downloaded as a "try and buy". I prefer this compiler to gcc mainly because it does not place a demand for a second run-time environment to support gcc/gnu differences from a "more" posix approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) I am revisiting this, as I would like to upgrade my forums and mysql 5.0 does not cut it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

I joined the list and will be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. I will be working with multiple levels of the OS, not the very very latest because I want the builds to be useable as broadly as possible, Ideally, a build on AIX 5.3 TL7 because I think this is the best place to start from (imho). But, for comparision I will also be trying with builds on AIX 6.1 and 7.1 - initially working from the vac (IBM) compiler, and later testing with gcc.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the years I have done some bug fixing on AIX, but not for the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may however be able to provide some help for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but I don't remember with OS I used the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my emails, I did find that MySQL did in 2001 work on AIX 4.3 with
the latest gcc back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to get MariaDB to work on AIX, just use the latest
possible OS and the newest compiler you can access and I will try to
help you to get that to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just post your questions or failing compiler issues on maria-developers@lists.launchpad.net and we try to help get things to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also include which compiler and other tools you are using!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I contacted IBM a few years back to ask them if they would like us to support MariaDB on AIX, but we never got any response from them.&lt;/p&gt;
