See for example &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20698"&gt;MDEV-20698&lt;/a&gt;. Also note that &lt;a href="https://mariadb.org/about/#maintenance-policy"&gt;MariaDB 10.7 is end-of-life&lt;/a&gt;, and there never was a 10.7.11 - the final version in that series was &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-1078-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.7.8&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally you should be running a current release in case it's a bug that has been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
