&lt;p&gt;"./MONyog-bin --version"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not have access to the machine where MONyog is installed, then the only way to look at the MONyog version is through the GUI (you will have to enter the "&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port_address&amp;gt;" of the machine where MONyog is installed in the browser)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also write to support@webyog.com if you have any queries. Sibin (Webyog)&lt;/p&gt;
