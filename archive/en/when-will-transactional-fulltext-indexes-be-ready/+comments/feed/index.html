Frequently updated fulltext indexes need to constantly acquire table locks, which is a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around the issue we've created duplicated tables that are updated hourly and converted all other tables to InnoDB so that we can get row level locking. Ideally we'd like to get row level locking on updates of tables that have full text indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We converted this weekend from the stock MySQL that comes with Centos 5 to &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-52/"&gt;MariaDB 5.2&lt;/a&gt; series. So far so good - system is faster and uses less resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will try converting our myisam fulltext tables to aria in the upcoming weeks. Its worth it for a crash safe system. And we'll be waiting for row level locking. Indeed, row level locking is more important than transactions. I dont know if that is the same for other clients, but we'd much rather see row or page locks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, our thanks for a great product. We appreciate the work you do, it makes a difference for us and we've come to rely on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if this is not the same as transactional, this should be a good start until we get full transactions into Aria (which will give you the rollback command).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that fulltext and crash safe is not as much tested as the rest of Aria, so if you decide to use it, please test them throughly and give is feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
