Check the php error log to see if something occurred in the query being in error rather than the result set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your multiple side database with multiple columns for MatrixCode looks odd as this is normally done in multiple tables with JOINs. Relook at the structure if the SQL you are writing is seeming abnormally complex.&lt;/p&gt;
