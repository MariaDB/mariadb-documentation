GIven that my cluster was upgraded version by version, I never saw that and never did the update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USE_GTID = slave_pos;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also it seems that you can start the slave with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='master.domain.com',
  MASTER_USER='replication_user',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
MASTER_LOG_FILE='mariadb-bin.000096',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=568;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;which is on the same page, but I coulnd't find anywhere else.
So I guess this is solved.&lt;/p&gt;
