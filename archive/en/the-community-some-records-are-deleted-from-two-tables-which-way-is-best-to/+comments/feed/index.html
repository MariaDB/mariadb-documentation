See &lt;a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/206677/mariadb-point-in-time-backup-recovery-with-binary-log-using-position"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don't have it enabled, but this is something that &lt;a href="/kb/en/system-versioned-tables/"&gt;system-versioned-tables&lt;/a&gt; would be ideal for. You could just query the table at the point in time before the records were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
