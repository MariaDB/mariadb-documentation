It has more information. You may want to increase the logging level in your systemctl script to see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a lot of the time this is due to a corrupted database file. (You do have backups, right?) If the log messages convince you of corruption, you can do an escalating series of innodb_force_recovery. Values greater than 0 will open your database read-only with various checks disabled, which may allow you to export your corrupted database files, and then you can start up in normal mode (innodb_force_recovery = 0) and you can DROP the offending table and re-import it.&lt;/p&gt;
