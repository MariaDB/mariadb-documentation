&lt;p&gt;As far as searching the Knowledgebase, there's a search box at the top of every page on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

But apparently, I need all kinds of help.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I'm confused about Askmonty.  Is there a way to search thru the current knowledgebase (without making a new posting)?  I'm not seeing it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I did import a couple tables of mine the simplistic way (convert to csv and transfer).  If there is a better way, I'd be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, after moving these tables my app is extremely slow.  I am using PHP and accessing Maria db thru the 32 bit ODBC drivers.  I have 32 bit PHP installed because I used access and it only has 32 bit drivers.  However, MS access is blazing fast compared to the same script on Maria db.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you trying to import an MS Access DB into MariaDB and failing, or are you just interesting in learning how to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several utilities out there which import MS Access databases in to MySQL. I have never used any so I don't know how good (or bad) any of them are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS Access can also be used as a front-end for MariaDB by connecting via ODBC. This would be a good way to transfer data (probably not as good as using a dedicated transfer app), but again, I've never tried it.&lt;/p&gt;
