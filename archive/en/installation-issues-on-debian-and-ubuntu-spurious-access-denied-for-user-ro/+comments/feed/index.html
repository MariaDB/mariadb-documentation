The problem has been attributed to the lack of passwords being placed in the file: "/etc/mysql/debian.cnf". I had initially avoided doing any modifications to this file, as it had the admonition "# Automatically generated for Debian scripts. DO NOT TOUCH!". After running out of options, I went ahead and modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course things were not that simple. I am using PHPMyAdmin and Firefox. Firefox has its own password saving feature. Turns out that the password that you need to enter in the file debian.cnf, after being generated by PHPMyAdmin and then saved by Firefox are the passwords that you need to enter in the file: "/etc/mysql/debian.cnf"&lt;/p&gt;

It also could be a check that the mariadb service is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are entries at a periodic interval that would probably be a logrotate script attempting to integrate with the server to rotate log files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular intervals could also be some monitoring program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solutions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ignoring it
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;changing the root user to use unix_socket authentication only (as these scripts run as root) and this keeps it secure without a password. In 10.4 onwards unix_socket auth and passwords are supported at the same time.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;find the two or more instances and edit their interaction with the server
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove the need, edit the service file to not attempt mysql_upgrade, and change the error-log to default blank (stdout) and let journalctl manage all the things done by logrotate (and disable the log-rotate).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
