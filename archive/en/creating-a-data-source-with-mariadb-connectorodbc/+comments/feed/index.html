I am running the server from the binary, and want to use a named pipe for connection. The command line arguments I am using for mariadb.exe are "--console --socket="MySQL" --named-pipe=1 --skip-networking=1". I need to connect to the server through the Mariadb ODBC wizard, but every time I click the 'Test DSN' button, I am given this error: "Plugin pvio_npipe could not be loaded: The specified module could not be found. Library path is 'pvio_npipe.dll'". In the Mariadb/lib/plugin folder there is no pvio_npipe.dll. Any pointers on how to fix this would be very appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to note:
My mariadb connection driver is version 3.1.
I can connect to the named pipe "MySQL" through heidiSQL, and it is found in list of open pipes&lt;/p&gt;
