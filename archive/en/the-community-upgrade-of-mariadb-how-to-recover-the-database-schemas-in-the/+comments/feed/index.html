&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to take a mariadb-dump of your Joomla 4 database. Stop the MariaDB-11.2 instance, replace the datadir with your original databases, start the MariaDB-11.2 service, and import the Jooma 4 backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note at the moment 11.2 is an Alpha release. Unless running on the very bleeding edge is something your willing to do as testing, I recommend moving back to 11.0 or 10.11 before restarting the MariaDB service in the previous instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
