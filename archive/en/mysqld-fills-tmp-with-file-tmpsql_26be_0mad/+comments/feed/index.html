Use lsof to find out what still had the file in use.&lt;/p&gt;

I did everything mentioned and then did so queries against large tables with group by and sorts thinking that I would see some files in my tmpdir location. Didn't see anything.  But, the co-worker is the one loading the data. I'll have him keep an eye out when loading to see data in the new tmpdir location.
Thanks for your help.&lt;/p&gt;

Didn't see this before my post above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run certain ALTER or CREATE commands on an InnoDB table,  a temporary table is created in mysql's tmpdir during the operation.The default value in my.cnf is /tmp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are loading the data, /tmp is being filled. I would suggest you change the value of tmpdir in my.cnf to be on a disk with more space. Stop mysql first, change the value in my.cnf and start mysql.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the tmpdir value is correct by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;show variables like "tmpdir";&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then try loading your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the value is not as you set it in my.cnf, make sure you have it in the correct section, [mysqld] or [mysqld-safe]&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like I need to set tmpdir= to a location that has a lot of room.  Since Oracle keeps temporary files in the same filesystem as the tablespaces, I'll try this here. &lt;/p&gt;
