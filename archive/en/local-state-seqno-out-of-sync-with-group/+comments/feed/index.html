Most likely you did not exactly what you described, maybe in a subtle and non-obvious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is safe to proceed with removing grastate.dat in a sense that the node will join the cluster and synchronize with it by copying the state with seqno 15898. However you will lose the 155 extra transactions that you have there now.&lt;/p&gt;
