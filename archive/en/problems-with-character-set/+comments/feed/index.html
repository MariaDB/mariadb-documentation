In the current production version, the default character set system is "utf8," while in the new version, it defaults to "utf8mb3." Despite my attempts, I haven't been able to change it. I've noticed that the discussions I've found are more geared towards standalone versions, whereas my situation involves a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-106/"&gt;MariaDB 10.6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/kb/en/unicode/"&gt;utf8 became a default for utfmb3&lt;/a&gt;. You can use the &lt;a href="/kb/en/old-mode/#utf8_is_utf8mb3"&gt;old_mode&lt;/a&gt; system variable to change the default to utf8mb4.&lt;/p&gt;
