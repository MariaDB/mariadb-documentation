&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/"&gt;MariaDB 10.0&lt;/a&gt;, if you enable the performance_schema there is a hosts table that I think has the information you're looking for. This table does not exist in the &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5&lt;/a&gt; performance_schema.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, to see blocked hosts:
select client from client_statistics where denied_connections=max_connect_errors. Or denied_connections&amp;gt;0, depending on what you need to know. And when you flush hosts, you just flush client_statistics table ("flush clients") to keep the counter in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

statistics, as u can see, need to be enable and they collect information until u dont disable (userstat = 1).
My question is different: how to see the hosts present in the cache , before the command FLUSH HOSTS.
Jeremy created "SHOW HOST_CACHE" for a patch, does Maria 55 has something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://kb.askmonty.org/en/user-statistics/"&gt;https://kb.askmonty.org/en/user-statistics/&lt;/a&gt;
I don't know if CLIENT_STATISTICS table covers all possible causes of an max_connect_errors increment... look at its columns.&lt;/p&gt;

I run Maria 55.
The max_connect_errors can increase for many reasons (not only connection errors), that s why i am looking for the hosts in cache and not the connection fail from the hosts. 
They are different things, please do not confuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, maybe MariaDB10's performance_schema could help you: the 'hosts' table contains successful connections.&lt;/p&gt;
