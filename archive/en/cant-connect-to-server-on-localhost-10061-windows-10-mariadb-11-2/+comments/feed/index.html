Rebooting with the original "my.ini" file restored the original connection, and after switching to the new "my.ini" with the new folder location, rebooting again linked MariaDB to the new location. So, as often is the case, rebooting will cure many ills. I assume that some setting remained in  the Registry (or other location) that was not purged or changed by exiting and restarting.&lt;/p&gt;
