&lt;p&gt;When compared to standalone server, galera node (assuming that the test was run against a galera cluster with a single node) should perform as good as standalone if not worse. So, I suspect the two servers were run with different configurations. One option would be to compare servers' system and status variables using SHOW VARIABLES &amp;amp; SHOW STATUS respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
