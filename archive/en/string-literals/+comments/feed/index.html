May be only when a specific option is set.
The reason is that I got bitten by literal string concatenation in the following case:
I have a given datamodel which contains enums in several records.
Then there is code which based on the value of the enum field does certain processing.
The code structure is typically like:
if foo_bar in ('enum0', 'enum1', ...) then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you forget to type the , then you get a different value to which foo_bar is never equal and you initially do not understand what is going on.
A warning when the script is processed about literal concatenation would trigger some extra inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
