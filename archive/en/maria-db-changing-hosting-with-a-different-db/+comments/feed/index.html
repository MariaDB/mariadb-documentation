Aria was formerly called Maria, which probably still confuses some people. Your example makes me think that the second hypotesys is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are moving to MyISAM, you should change ENGINE=Aria to ENGINE=MyISAM, and remove PAGE_CHECKSUM, because it is an Aria-specific clause. You can obtain something similar with CHECKSUM=1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the exact meaning of these clauses, see &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/create-table/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/create-table/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
