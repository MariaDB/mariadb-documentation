This should be mentioned as a warning or this article removed until it is fixed as the corruption will cause latent crashes, which is even worse than the backup failing altogether.
Running mysqlcheck --auto-repair on the backup isn't enough to detect corruption, only mysqloptimize could find it.
Running &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-10411-release-notes/"&gt;mariadb 10.4.11&lt;/a&gt; at the moment and the bugs I hit are documented on the bug tracker already (&lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18193"&gt;MDEV-18193&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19978"&gt;MDEV-19978&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-23653"&gt;MDEV-23653&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
