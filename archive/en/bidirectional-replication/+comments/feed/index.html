&lt;p&gt;- Master-Master replication (also called Circular replication - that is B replicates from A, and A replicates from B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- MariaDB Galera Cluster - but for now it is not available on Windows and you might need a 3rd node&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would go for Master-Master replication.&lt;/p&gt;
