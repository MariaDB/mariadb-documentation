What I was looking for where ASSERTIONS, and they are nearly implemented by nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

Most important: This solution should be thread safe:
CREATE TABLE Test (
  startTime bigint(20),
  stopTime bigint(20),
  CONSTRAINT overlapping CHECK ( (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Test r WHERE r.startTime &amp;lt; stopTime AND r.endTime &amp;gt; startTime LIMIT 1) = 0 )
);
Even more elegant would it be to put the CHECK content into a function. But I consider that to be a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

Can you give an example of what you're looking for that works on another database?&lt;/p&gt;
