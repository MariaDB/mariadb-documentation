Sorry, I would describe only the users point of view, not technical internals.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your help. I see, there is no easy answer for this and I have to use additional (OS-specific) solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unsure whether there is a feature like MS-SQL TDE (transparent data encryption) and only I missed it. Therefore my question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your fast response. This forum and your work is of precious help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best regards,
Thomas&lt;/p&gt;

No idea where you have this information from.. Password hashes are stored, yes, but you (or anyone else) will have hard times retrieving clear password from hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;seems to be related to your question.&lt;/p&gt;

You would need to run mysqld service under the same user. Don't give untrused people administrator level access to the box (so they can change the ACL), then you should be fine without encryption. "Someone" would not be able to copy files unless he has read access to the files.&lt;/p&gt;

But it is not as simple as you write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our customers have simple networks. Normaly no special server machines and no specific administration departments. But they have to deal with staff members, which would make "backups" for their personal use of companies data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side we as the developer of the application will ensure only our certified solution will do data modifications and other apps can't do any harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, encryption (especially easy solutions) have not 100% guarantee to withstand the next 50 years. But inappropriate access should not work this easy way.&lt;/p&gt;
