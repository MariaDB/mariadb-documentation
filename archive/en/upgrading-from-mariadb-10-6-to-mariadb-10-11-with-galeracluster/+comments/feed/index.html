I use rolling upgrade method, upgrade one node first and try rejoin the cluster. But the upgraded node failed to join the cluster !! I can not find any document here. Is mariadb with galera cluster upgrade from 10.6 to 11.4 not okey ?
[ I am success upgrade from 10.6.12 to 10.11.9, but failed from 10.11.9 to 11.4.3 too. ]&lt;/p&gt;
