Now (by default, as per the old mode setting), utf8 is an alias for utf8mb3. The intention I believe is at some point to switch off the default old mode setting, so that utf8 will then be an alias for utf8mb4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should be:
"10.6.1 changed utf8 to be an alias for utf8mb4..... imply utf8mb3 by changing the..."&lt;/p&gt;
