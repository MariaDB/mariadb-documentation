First it says "applies only when autocommit is set to 0 or the SELECT is enclosed in a transaction" (notice the OR in between). And later says: "If autocommit is set to 1, the LOCK IN SHARE MODE and FOR UPDATE clauses have no effect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example MySQL documentation says it like this, which seems to be clearer: "Locking reads are only possible when autocommit is disabled (either by beginning transaction with START TRANSACTION or by setting autocommit to 0."&lt;/p&gt;
