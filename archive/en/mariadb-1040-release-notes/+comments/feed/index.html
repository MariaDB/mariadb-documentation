Are you stupid? I've been using MariaDB for a long time, but I can not understand how you can not take care of reliability so much?
In case of power loss (or hard reset), the database become damaged!!! This is inconceivable!!! Mysql does not start due to errors. Are you f&lt;strong&gt; kidding me? It has happened to me several times already. That should be the basis - RELIABILITY!!!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
