&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/connectorj-5.1.5-micro/"&gt;http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/connectorj-5.1.5-micro/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(don't be confused by "5.1.5", it is a wrong label, repo is a based on 5.1.15)&lt;/p&gt;

That server supports microseconds is good, but you also need clients support microseconds. In this case it would be JDBC driver that needs support for microseconds. I do not know the current state of Connector/J, but you can check with pure JDBC calls (store and retrieve e.g java.sql.Timestamp with fractional seconds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hibernate is yet another level which theoretically can lose milliseconds, I have not looked at it closely though, and do not know if there is anything that can be done in Hibernate configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
