Other compound statements, like &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; don't say "not atomic" explicitly, but they are also not atomic. For an atomic compound statement one has to use &lt;code&gt;BEGIN ATOMIC&lt;/code&gt;, which is not supported as of now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. It's not clear if this can fail to return a row:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF (EXISTS (SELECT * FROM table WHERE id=1)) THEN SELECT data FROM table WHERE id=1;ELSE SELECT 'data does not exist';END IF;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...if the EXISTS() is executed in a separate transaction to the subsequent SELECT, it might.&lt;/p&gt;
