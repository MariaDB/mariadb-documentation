And I think the following three features might play an essential role in that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. SHOW EXPLAIN command
2. Engine independent table statistics
3. Faster UNIQUE key generation with ALTER TABLE&lt;/p&gt;

What feature does version 10 have that keeps you from using 5.5?&lt;/p&gt;

That is good to know about InnoDB, and I do realize that it is in alpha. That version will only be used for testing purposes. However, I am hoping that 10.0 will be available by mid next year.&lt;/p&gt;
