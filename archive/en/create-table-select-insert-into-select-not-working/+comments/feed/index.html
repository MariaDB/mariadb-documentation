&lt;p&gt;There are three operation modes for SELECTs in ColumnStore. One is the fastest, another we call it disabled vtable could be much slower. More information is here[1].
Complex SELECT queries used in INSERT..SELECT could be run in disabled vtable mode thus their execution time is unpredictable. There is a workaround this. You should use mcsmysql pipelining its output to cpimport. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mcsmysql -e 'complex select query' | cpimport &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS will process the query in vtable mode then, not disabled vtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I would suggest to ask questions in the dedicated Google Group b/c you could get the answer faster.&lt;/p&gt;
