&lt;p&gt;To make it short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The GPL of the MySQL ODBC connecter never affects the application. This is because your the ODBC connector is a standardizes system plugin which your application never uses directly as it's loaded on demand by the ODBC manager and can easily be replaced with other connectors.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are not distributing the MySQL/MariaDB server with your application then your are not bound by the GPL in the server.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your app works with more than one database (which should be trivial if you are using ODBC), then you can freely distribute your application also with the MySQL server, as the server is then an optional but not required component.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Your are buying a license from Oracle for the ODBC connector and not MySQL, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a FOSS license exception for connectors, but your product is commercial, hence where it gets interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a license for the connector, and you can use MySQL or MariaDB. If for some reason you do not want to pay Oracle for an ODBC connector, maybe you can get another connector that someone writes for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you send your contact details to sales@montyprogram.com we might be able to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
