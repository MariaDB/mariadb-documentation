Bad news for you is that MSI has nothing to do with your problem, it is the server that crashes, as you can find in the log 
"CAQuietExec:  161025 20:35:45  D:\Program Files\&lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5&lt;/a&gt;\bin\mysqld.exe (mysqld 5.5.53-MariaDB) starting as process 3424 ...
CAQuietExec:  161025 20:35:45  mysqld got exception 0xc000001d ;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WE had a bug report on that  here &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-11091"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-11091&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to comment in the issue. I could not reproduce this on any machines I have, nor the original reporter could reproduce it on anything but  Xen virtualized box. So it seemed a problem with virtualization to us. &lt;/p&gt;
