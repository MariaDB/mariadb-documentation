I would suggest to clarify the release notes because I missed at first glance to see the link between batch prepared statement insert using Bulk In and LOAD FILE problem. Reviewing the source code everything get clearer. Thanks for your help&lt;/p&gt;

This will be corrected in 3.0.6. Until then, setting option `allowLocalInfile` to false will revert the problem&lt;/p&gt;
