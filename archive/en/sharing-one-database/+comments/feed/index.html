The only way to start the server is to change the password every time you start a different os. I tried setting the password the same in both .cnf files but this didn't work. I suspect the passwords have a UUID in each OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since they would be using the same data dir, every change made when you are running Linux will be there when you boot to Windows, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won't work if you have them both running simultaneously, but if only one or the other operating system is running at a given time then it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work. But like I said, I've never tried it.&lt;/p&gt;
