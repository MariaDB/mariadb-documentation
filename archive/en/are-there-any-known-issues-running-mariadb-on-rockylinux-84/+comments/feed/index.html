&lt;p&gt;the script was using the WRONG password. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a TOTAL AND COMPLETE IDIOT,  i tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU to Daniel Black.&lt;/p&gt;

If there is no logs related to the shutdown of mariadb, this could be:
a) lack of filesystem space where the error log is stored
b) the server where mariadb was running ran out of memory
c) a user or system process hard killed mariadb (SIGKILL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dmesg or system journal should provide an indicator of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are logs beyond that point they'll indicate the shutdown cause. "Shutdown by unknown" is a indication that a signal caused the shutdown (SIGTERM or equivalent)&lt;/p&gt;
