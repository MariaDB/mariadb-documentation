I followed the steps given using brew and everything went well. When i tried installing the qgraph plugin, I get this eror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MariaDB [tenw_beta_dev]&amp;gt; INSTALL PLUGIN oqgraph SONAME 'ha_oqgraph.so'; ERROR 1126 (HY000): Can't open shared library '/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/5.5.28/lib/plugin/ha_oqgraph.so' (errno: 2 dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/5.5.28/lib/plugin/ha_oqgraph.so, 2): image not found)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file was not found in that location. How do we get that so for macOSX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to install OQGRAPH from MariaDB, it complained that it wasn't available. Then I discovered that you need to feed "--with-plugin_oqgraph" to the configure script. That didn't work either, complaining about a missing "boost" directory. That led me on a googlehunt that eventually turned up that open-source lib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad it was a sunny day. If I had done all that work on a rainy day, I'd be upset at not being outside working the farm insteadâ€¦ :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm contacting the OQGRAPH authors to ask that they please include BOOST in their distribution, or at least mention it prominently.&lt;/p&gt;

To use it, use &lt;a href="/kb/en/install-plugin/"&gt;INSTALL PLUGIN&lt;/a&gt; to activate it, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;MariaDB [(none)]&amp;gt; INSTALL PLUGIN oqgraph SONAME 'ha_oqgraph.so';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.48 sec)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This only needs to be done once. Once activated, OQGRAPH will appear in the list of installed storage engines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;MariaDB [(none)]&amp;gt; SHOW ENGINES;
