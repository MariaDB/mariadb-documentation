Get no' of rows in table
2. Gen rand number(s) between 1 and no of rows (no duplicates)
3. Return row(s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sorting should be required, why would that even be an idea? Amazing that these are still the solutions in use... Should have been internal feature long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just add SELECTRAND * FROM xyz WHERE x = y LIMIT 10
etc&lt;/p&gt;

A UDF can't do better than use the PRIMARY KEY.  For MyISAM, the location of a row is the byte offset into the .MYD; there is no list of these to probe.  For InnoDB, one should provide a PK; if you don't there is an inaccessible 6-byte number that acts sort of like AUTO_INCREMENT; again, not practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could one write a UDF that would use an RNG to select rows by their internal row number to avoid a full table scan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed that RAND() appears to be biased. It will often return from within a small subset of records over and over, which seems to change every day, leading me to suspect they're using a Linear Congruential RNG seeded with the date.&lt;/p&gt;
