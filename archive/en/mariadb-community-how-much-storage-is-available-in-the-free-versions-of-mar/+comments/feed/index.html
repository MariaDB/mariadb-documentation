&lt;p&gt;Answer Answered by dbart in this comment.
InnoDB/XtraDB tables can be up to 64TB (terabytes) in size. On top of this you can have multiple tables per database and multiple databases per server. Usually the size and space limits of your underlying storage and operating system are reached long before MariaDB's internal limits are reached.&lt;/p&gt;
