&lt;p&gt;While its hardly a pretty option you can create a new master and use &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/replication-filters/#change-master-options"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/replication-filters/#change-master-options&lt;/a&gt; to filter out the gtids in the replication stream that feeds into the replica being recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

GTIDs in MySQL are not implemented in the same way, and only the MySQL version of the tool does. There is an open task, &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4989"&gt;MDEV-4989&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't appear to have been worked on in a while. I suggest voting/commenting there.&lt;/p&gt;
