For further information please read more about the option files
&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/#option-file-locations-on-linux-unix-mac"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/#option-file-locations-on-linux-unix-mac&lt;/a&gt;
Please see more about `--defaults-file=#myfile`, which only read default options from the given file `#myfile`.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure I understand where your problem comes from. Is it a packaging/deployment problem (related to RPM), or is it a problem of mariadb server not reading your specific my.cnf configuration file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could you please explain better the steps of your deployment and what you are trying to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,
Faustin&lt;/p&gt;
