At that point the configs in /etc/mysql/* were not adjusted. To better handle this, it should be noted that automatic daemon starts should be rpevented. A quick and easy way to do is is by using the policy-rc.d:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;tee /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
!/bin/sh exit 101 
EOF 

chmod +x /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the installation of the packages is done, the configs can be adjusted and then MariaDB can be started as outlined in the guide. Afterwards /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d can be removed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that mysql_upgrade is not really necessary on default Ubuntu/Debian systems as the included /etc/mysql/debian-start script already does a mysql_upgrade during startup.&lt;/p&gt;
