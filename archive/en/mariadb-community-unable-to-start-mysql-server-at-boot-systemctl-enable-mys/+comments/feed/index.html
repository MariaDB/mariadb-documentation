Please, understand I am completely NEW to this. So, the information was completely jibberish to me.  I did not understand what they were talking about. I am sorry about that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did see that they said something about symbolic links. and tried copying the file into a specific directory. The mysqld.service file or think the mariadb.service. I just realized recently that Fedora has departed with MYSQL and teamed up with MariaDB.  I am doing my best to learn. I just re-read all the comments in that page.  So, far I did notice someone tried to run the command, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; "systemctl enable mariadb.service" and that has worked from them. I will try that command my server and see what happens. It has something to do with Symbolic links.  and the mysqld.service is a symbolic link. So, it makes sense to use mariadb.service command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Migrating from MySQL to MariaDB has caused few issues. But I think we can get through it.  At leaset, for being completely NEW to this, At least, I did my research.  I have some people who just blindly post on Linux forums for their work assignments and without doing any work? &lt;/p&gt;

Please do; not only do they answer your question there "Is this a known issue?", but also explain in detail what the reason of the issue is. &lt;/p&gt;
