&amp;amp; installing Maria5.5.31 
I keep seeing the following databases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; '#mysql50#.performance_schema'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but i don't see any physical folders on the data directory
(I am running multi instance mysql so i was wondering how i can get rid of the performance _schema database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my cnf file has includes the following attribute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;performance_schema = 0 &lt;/p&gt;
