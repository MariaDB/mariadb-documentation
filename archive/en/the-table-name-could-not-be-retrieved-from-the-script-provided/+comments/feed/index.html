SSIS = Micrrosoft SQL Server Integration Service - and it is not available in express edition. It is hard to validate not knowing how the utility works.
According to your query, you only have query to create table and this works, you told just that.
IMHO, just guessing, your SSIS should generate some query related to manipulating data /insert/update/delete in order to say MariaDB what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
