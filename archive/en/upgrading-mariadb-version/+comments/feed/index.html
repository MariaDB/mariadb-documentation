&lt;p&gt;If you could create a test case for this and file it in our bug system, we would be happy to take a look at it to ensure that this doesn't happen to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

The manual tells to run mysql_upgrade on upgrades, you did it and it fixed the problem. Looks good to me :)&lt;/p&gt;
