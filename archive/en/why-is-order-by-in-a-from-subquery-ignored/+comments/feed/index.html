It's however not guaranteed according to the SQL standard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this correct behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;

This totally screws up previously working code that attempts to group based on the results of the ordered subquery. You cannot sort before grouping on the top level SELECT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limit hack seems to work, but must have a performance hit, so thanks @rspadim&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have another idea ?&lt;/p&gt;

But creating an unnecessary temporary table doesn't seem a great solution to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT field1, field2 FROM (
SELECT field1, field2 FROM table1 
ORDER BY field2
LIMIT 18446744073709551615
) alias
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this cause the optimizer to create a temporary table, and use filesort to order the query&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the limit number is a 64bit unsigned -1 (2^64-1), this is a big number and can work with 99.999% of queries i know&lt;/p&gt;
