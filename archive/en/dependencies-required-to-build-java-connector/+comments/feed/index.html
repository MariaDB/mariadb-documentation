&lt;p&gt;AWS is only used for test, so technically those can be removed from pom.xml, if test directory is deleted, but that's not a good solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only solution if not connected to build jar is to have a local maven repository containing all those dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all the slf4j versions including the ones that only have pom file but no corresponding jar files are needed as well? Is it possible to build without aws support?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jar can be downloaded (&lt;a href="https://downloads.mariadb.com/Connectors/java/"&gt;https://downloads.mariadb.com/Connectors/java/&lt;/a&gt;) , but there is no way to build without having those dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

This downloads 51 versions into the local repository. Some of these versions only contain pom files but no jar files. Is there a way to limit these to fewer versions without causing build failures?&lt;/p&gt;
