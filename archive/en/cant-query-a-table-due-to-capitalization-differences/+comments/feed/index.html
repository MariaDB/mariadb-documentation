&lt;p&gt;The original name was gbl_tblUsers but I've since renamed it. However, it's still not reading the object.&lt;/p&gt;

In your explanation you only mention the lower case version. Where is it not displayed in that way? What is the value of &lt;a href="/kb/en/server-system-variables/#lower_case_table_names"&gt;lower_case_table_names&lt;/a&gt;? It should be &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
