&lt;p&gt;If this is the case for you, look at `journalctl -n 40 -u mariadb.service` for more detailed information as to why mariadb didn't start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more detail as to the source MySQL version, the destination MariaDB version, and the errors occurring on startup are needed to help you get past your current state. Please also take a detailed read of the migration article above. Please make sure you have a mysql backup before beginning the migration.&lt;/p&gt;
