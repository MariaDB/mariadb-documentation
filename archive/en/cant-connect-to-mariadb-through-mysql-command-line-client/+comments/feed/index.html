You can specify this when it is being built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also override the default location in the [client] section of the my.cnf (or my.ini on Windows) so you won't need to specify this on each invocation of the command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[harry@srv-rhsoft:]$ mysql --help &amp;gt; help.txt
[harry@srv-rhsoft:]$ cat help.txt | grep socket
  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe,
  -S, --socket=name   The socket file to use for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the other hand i use sane operating systems where packages come from central repos and are built to work together&lt;/p&gt;

Why do porters mess with the socket location? Why can't we all just agree to stick it in the same place? And then there's the various clients, all deciding that THEY know the One True Location of the socket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caused me days of troubleshooting with the Homebrew port of MariaDB. It was putting in one place, php.ini was looking for it somewhere else, phpMyAdmin was looking for it in yet another place, and it seemed every tool I downloaded looked for it in their own special place -- configurable, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of frustration, I made a list of all the likely locations for the socket, and linked them all together. This is working fine... until something else unexpected happens, and the original socket file goes away...&lt;/p&gt;
