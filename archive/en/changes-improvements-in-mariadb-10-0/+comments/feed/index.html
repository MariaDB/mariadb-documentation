Because Percona XtraDB-5.6 wasn't quite ready by the time of 10.0.3 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-1006-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.0.6&lt;/a&gt; or 10.0.7 we expect to have new Percona XtraDB enabled by default instead of InnoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

can have and work with different timezones. That means that each
connection in a multi-source setup works exactly like if you would
have a normal master-slave setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timestamp and NOW() are replicated in GMT, and is thus independent of
timezones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIME, DATETIME and DATE are replicated verbatim and there is no
timezone involved either on master or slave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With multi-source replication, you are obviously dealing with multiple Masters going to a single Slave. What if one (or more) of those Masters were configured for a different time zone? How does multi-source replication cater for Masters that are on a different time zone to the Slave? Wouldn't there be a conflict as far as date values are concerned?&lt;/p&gt;

You can see our release schedule at &lt;a href="http://mariadb.org/jira"&gt;http://mariadb.org/jira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these are target or planned release dates, but not a promise. We want to release at these dates, we're trying to. But sometimes, we might miss them. Or we might change them, and the page above will show a new date, if we do.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a target release date for 10.0.2?&lt;/p&gt;
