&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By ".. how MariaDB structure its code ?" I mean, if I develop for instance a sales module, to organize the code,I need to gather the stored procedures,functions.. in a same container  which will be linked to the sales subjects (as package in Oracle) ,so for maintenance it's easier than having separate procedures .. is there a way to accomplish this in MariaDb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mean the server, it is written in C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UDFs must be written in C or a compatible language. Here you can see an example in Go:
&lt;a href="http://databaseblog.myname.nl/2015/10/a-mysql-udf-written-in-go.html"&gt;http://databaseblog.myname.nl/2015/10/a-mysql-udf-written-in-go.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stored procedures, functions and triggers must be written in procedural SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-As the Oracle package doesn't exist, how MariaDB structure its code ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stored procedures are stored in a database, you can see the database as a namespace. There is no package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Is there a plugin which can call a Java proc in MariaDB , other than the UDF function (as MariaDB cannot call directly a java proc)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, currently there is no way to write a procedure in an external language. A community member is working on that, but I can't say if MariaDB is interested in this contribution, or when they will consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
