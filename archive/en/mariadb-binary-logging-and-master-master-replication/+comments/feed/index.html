There's no need for 'FLUSH PRIVILEGES'. There's no need for replication filters on information_schema or performance schema, they aren't replicated anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caution about using /var/log/mysql as some logrotate rules may hit the binary log which can be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you following &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/setting-up-replication/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/setting-up-replication/&lt;/a&gt; though to see if you missed anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything in the error-log?&lt;/p&gt;
