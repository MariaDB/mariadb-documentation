I couldn't find anything about it, is it undocumented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISABLE_SHARED has the same effect and its in the cmake -L options. So I guess it should be the documented one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I should be using "cmake --build" instead of "make -j4" (I have 4 vCPU on my server). Will cmake --build be faster? Or what's the difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cmake can use multiple things to build. "cmake --build" will work with all of the, but make -j4 will only work if CMAKE_GENERATOR is set to makefiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; I see so many different guides ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things work. Do tell us if something doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have seen guides show some "mysql_secure_installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-secure-installation/"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; "Note that many of the reasons for the existence of this script no longer apply".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if I install from source, will there be a systemd service included?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you have libsystemd-dev installed when you compiled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, the service file is in /usr/local/mysql/support-files/systemd/mariadb.service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will need to be copied/linked from /lib/systemd/system/ or /etc/systemd/system for systemd to recognise it.  systemctl daemon-reload after its moved there and then systemctl start mariadb.service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;cmake . -DWITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS=1 -DWITH_MARIABACKUP=0 -DPLUGIN_PERFSCHEMA=NO -DWITH_UNIT_TESTS=0

cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install . 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn't get any systemd files now (to start as a service). Any clue what might have gone wrong? I can't find any "mysqld.service" file anywhere in fact. How would I be able to actually start the mariadb server now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that "-DWITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS=1" is just what I need! I couldn't find anything about it, is it undocumented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I should be using "cmake --build" instead of "make -j4" (I have 4 vCPU on my server). Will cmake --build be faster? Or what's the difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see so many different guides (even on MariaDB's website) on how to build this from source and it always differs something in the commands. It's a bit confusing, but hopefully I can get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen guides show some "mysql_secure_installation". Is that what I should run once I have built and installed it? Or how should I proceed? (For setting up users with password authentication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I install from source, will there be a systemd service included? So that I can turn on/off MariaDB as I wish? E.g. "systemctl stop mariadb" (or maybe it's mysqld?). Sorry for these questions, but I see so many different approaches to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You both seem like absolute MariaDB experts. I really appreciate your help, it means a lot! You are awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

"-DWITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS=1 -DWITH_MARIABACKUP=0"
This excludes all server plugins that are built as shared libraries, you do not need to list them individually, as you did.  -DWITH_MARIABACKUP=0 excludes mariabackup, in case you do not need it. You can add -DPLUGIN_PERFSCHEMA=NO, if you do not need performance schema (this is not built as shared library, thus unaffected by -DWITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 10.11 packages are part of Debian, newer version are available as repositories obtained from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config&amp;amp;d=Debian+12+%22Bookworm%22&amp;amp;v=11.2"&gt;https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config&amp;amp;d=Debian+12+%22Bookworm%22&amp;amp;v=11.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.2 has stable releases now, but if you want a series with bug fixes that is going to continue for as long as Debian 12 recommend sticking to the 10.11 LTS release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally packages are a little more inclusive than a bare minimal, they include plugins that are DYNAMIC but not installed, and for those plugins that require additional dependencies those are separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a minimal build you can take any PLUGIN_X=DYNAMIC and add that to the =NO list without spending too much time considering what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "make" equivalent for those that have read the cmake introduction are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
&lt;/pre&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Daniel Black</dc:creator><guid>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/bare-minimum-mariadb-cmake-options/+comments/6501</guid></item></channel></rss>
