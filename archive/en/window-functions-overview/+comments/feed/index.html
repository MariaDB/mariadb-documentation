&lt;p&gt;SELECT pk, c, count(*) over win1 FROM table1 WINDOW win1 AS (PARTITION by c ORDER by pk);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or use the named window with adjustments applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELECT pk, c, count(*) over (win1 ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING) FROM table1 WINDOW win1 AS (PARTITION by c ORDER by pk);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or define a succession of named windows, optionally based on preceding ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELECT pk, c, count(*) over (win2 ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING) FROM table1 WINDOW win1 AS (PARTITION by c), win2 AS (win1 ORDER by pk);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Window function queries are characterised by the OVER keyword, following which the set of rows used for the calculation is specified."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to reword it to make it clearer? Note that I am a non-native english speaker, and that the sentence might be grammatically correct and make sense, but I just can't wrap my head around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you plan to implement lag and lead in the near future?&lt;/p&gt;
