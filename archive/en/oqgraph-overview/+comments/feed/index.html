can you tell me how did you install oqgraph with galera??
I can't install it on Galera server, I get the error : " ERROR 1126 (HY000): Can't open shared library 'ha_oqgraph.so' (errno: 8, API version for STORAGE ENGINE plugin OQGRAPH not supported by this version of the server)". 
let me know if there is any resource or link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in Advance 
Regards
Maziar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm procrastinating the move to Galera, in the hope that someone will extensively test OQGRAPH+Galera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that bug can be workarounded, so it is not the huge problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both your answer and Arjen Lentz's answer are positive. However, it is not yet clear to me if OQGRAPH is used with Galera in the real world. I don't want to be the first one who does this in production...&lt;/p&gt;
