It's best to add this as a feature request on &lt;a href="/kb/en/jira-project-planning-and-tracking/"&gt;JIRA&lt;/a&gt; so that everybody who'd be involved in the change can discuss. JIRA is the MariaDB project planning and tracking tool found at &lt;a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/"&gt;https://mariadb.atlassian.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's impossible (aka: not immediate) make something like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget &lt;a href="http://...maria-last-version.msi"&gt;http://...maria-last-version.msi&lt;/a&gt;
... pack-with-support-file...
... deploy a last-version silent installer...&lt;/p&gt;

I know some projects use it, but for MariaDB the current convention is safer, where it's clear in advance from the name of the file what's being installed or downloaded, and the list of mirrors can be kept updated. With your suggestion, an outdated mirror could easily lead to the wrong version unknowingly being used, and a lot of wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
