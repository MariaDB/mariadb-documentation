&lt;p&gt;Is there anyway to use Connect Engine in this scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one table and multiple files that are created and inserted into this table. 
I am using LOAD DATA INFILE command and insert these files to the table. Every such file (which has a specific format) is created periodicaly, lets say every 3 secs.
The table can be really huge, up to 400M rows (each file has 3-7000 rows).
Can i create a Connect table that "understands" when a new such file is created (in a specific directory lets say that has the name of the Connect table!) and indexing it automatically? What about querying at the same time?
Can this scenario be functional somehow with Connect Engine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, John.&lt;/p&gt;
