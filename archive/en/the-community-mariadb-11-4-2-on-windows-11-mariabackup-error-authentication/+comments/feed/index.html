You can't load client plugin into server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just need  plugin-dir under [client], usually. But mariabackup is slightly (or not so slightly) weird, it uses the server's  builtin client, so there can be problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An  educated guess is that you simply mistype the password, therefore server tries to use another plugin, which is gssapi, which then fails on reasons we do not know of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can also share you my.ini?
Best thing you can do is to create a bug at &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/&lt;/a&gt; , with detailed "how to reproduce".  I  gave it a try, and it worked for me, but maybe you installed it differently somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
