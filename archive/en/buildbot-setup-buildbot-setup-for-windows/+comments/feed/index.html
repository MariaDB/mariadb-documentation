I had Python 2.7 on my Windows 7 and had a terrible time compiling and setting it up. Today (20101228) I uninstalled Python 2.7 and put 2.6 there, along with other various uninstall and reinstall, and knock on wood, it appears to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing: :%s/buildbot/buildslave&lt;/p&gt;
