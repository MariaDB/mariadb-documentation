So far, I only seem to get -1 from mysql_get_socket, is there a way to make this work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you point the link? MariaDB links are too messy I cannot find anything... The only thing I have found are the mariadb-native-client which I based my work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i have done concurrency using that with thread for now until I find the other source :)&lt;/p&gt;

LGPL-licensed. I have not been involved with this library, but from what you
write it sounds like it has not been updated to include the non-blocking
feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the client library provided in the main MariaDB source tree, you
should find the non-blocking API you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are located? I am working to make a new C++ lib that embed all mysql call "mariadb++" but the only thing missing is concurency...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, nice article!&lt;/p&gt;
