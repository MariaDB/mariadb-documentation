&lt;p&gt;It was a rather massive upgrade version wise...
We went from 10.1 to 10.5.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I run the select on it's own it takes a few seconds to run. Thats why I assumed that it was not the select that was slowing things down.
Please see the explain of the select below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt; &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;select_type&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;table&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;possible_keys&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;key&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;key_len&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;ref&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;rows&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;PRIMARY&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;m&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;index&amp;#34;	\N	&amp;#34;PRIMARY&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;3&amp;#34;	\N	&amp;#34;269&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;Using where&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;PRIMARY&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;md&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;ref&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;id timestamp,meter_id&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;meter_id&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;3&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;stackTest.m.meter_id&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;7854&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;Using index&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;2&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;DEPENDENT SUBQUERY&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;md&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;ref&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;id timestamp,timeStamp,meter_id&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;id timestamp&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;3&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;func&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;7854&amp;#34;	&amp;#34;Using where; Using index&amp;#34;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both tables have an autoincrement primary key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tested the query several times and whilst the select improves after the first iteration the insert does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you please expand on the "InnoDB locality problem in time series" comment you have mentioned? Just for context I am a developer so I am not well versed in the setup of the database itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,
S.&lt;/p&gt;

If you upgrade from 10.5.7 to 10.5.8 I would NOT expect any issues. If you upgrade from 10.3.x to 10.5.8 I am not surprised...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you sure, that it is NOT the SELECT? Because I would bet on the SELECT... Can you prove this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3rd it would be interesting to know what is the PK of both tables? So possibly you are running into the InnoDB locality problem in time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you tested the query several times? If it is horribly slow just the first time and if this only/always happens after a MariaDB restart (caching issues) then you run indeed into the InnoDB locality problem in time series.&lt;/p&gt;
