The &lt;code&gt;@%&lt;/code&gt; user is allowed to connect from anywhere. If you were to use something like &lt;code&gt;'username'@'192.168.0.123'&lt;/code&gt; then the user would be only allowed to connect from that IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the user is allowed to do on the database is controlled with the &lt;a href="/kb/en/grant/"&gt;GRANT&lt;/a&gt; SQL command. By default newly created userd are allowed to do very little and access to the tables needs to be granted.&lt;/p&gt;
