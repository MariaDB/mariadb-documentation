If one installs the mariadbclinet-x64, all the development environment must be under x64, and *not* win32.
This can be set under the Property Sheet of the Project.
On the very top of the windows displaying the properties, the user can see "win32" environment (even though the Visual Studio 2012 can do x64 and was installed under Win7 x64).
opening the list of choices does NOT offer x64, but just new...
The user must chose "new..." environment which will then offer "x64" as a possible new choice.
Then, by miracle, on the next build, a successful link will occur (if everything else (such as correctly specifying the library to link, for instance, as suggested by Sergii) is in order, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Thank you Sergii for your answer, which could not be more helpful, because I did not provide you with enough information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my answer will help other programmers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your very quick answer and very informative link, which I will thoroughly study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my first tests failed, (same error). However, I do believe that you were perfectly right, and that after you kindly indicated me the right direction to go, I will finally reach success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that will be the case (hopefully very soon), I'll put a word here with the complete solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thank you for having taken to pain to reformat my question, which will not be necessary next time, since I discovered the very discreet link at the bottom of this page, which points to  Wiki Creole syntax (I had previously tested, with no success, obviously, BBCode). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, all my thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olivier Freiman, Paris, France&lt;/p&gt;
