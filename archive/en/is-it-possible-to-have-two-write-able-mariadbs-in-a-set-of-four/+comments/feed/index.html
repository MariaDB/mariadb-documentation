To configure it, you can use &lt;a href="/kb/en/multi-source-replication/"&gt;multi-source-replication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can work as long as you guarantee that no two writes can ever conflict between Server 1 and Server 3. This is usually quite hard to guarantee if you intend the same applications to write to both Server1 and Server 3. One option would be to use a Galera cluster but the performance might not be optimal if the nodes are located far apart.&lt;/p&gt;
