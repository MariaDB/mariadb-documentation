I am running Galera 25.3.20(r3703) with Maria 10.1.25 in the exact same configuration as the site (3 servers round robin) and can not reproduce this error, unless - like OP, i run it in parallel on 3 machines, two does not do the trick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you have any luck with wsre_thread_count.  Moving to a writable failover node in haproxy is really simple for my setup, but if there was another solution, that would be great!&lt;/p&gt;
