It's also not related in any way to MariaDB Enterprise Release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please submit the problem it to the &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org"&gt;MariaDB bug database&lt;/a&gt; so that we can process it properly.  Please also include the relevant error logs and the commands that goes wrong.  You should also try to manually run the query on the slave that gives you errors to check if you can repeat the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
