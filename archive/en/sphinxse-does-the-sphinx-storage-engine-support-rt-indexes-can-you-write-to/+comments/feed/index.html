&lt;p&gt;While in theory it's now possible to have it proxy INSERTs, DELETEs and other writes to Sphinx, it was never initially designed for this, so that change could be cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However we have a subproject underway in Sphinx to enable native replication directly from MySQL to Sphinx, without any plugins or SEs or whatever. Looks like that's what you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you'd like to be an early alpha tester for that, once it becomes useable, let me know :) My email is shodan at sphinxsearch dot com.&lt;/p&gt;
