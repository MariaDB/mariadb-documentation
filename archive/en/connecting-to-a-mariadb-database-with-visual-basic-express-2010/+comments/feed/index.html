Just use Connector/NET and write the same code, as if database was MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

data for use in a Visual Basic 2010 Express application. Specifically to pull six fields from a table of  23, and then write these out to a NFC
contactless card as text. Administering MariaDB via heidi is great. Have had no problems  there.
Thanks
Jules&lt;/p&gt;

This limitation does not apply do VS Professional or higher i.e starting with VS Professional, Connector/NET's Visual Studio plugin is actually usable&lt;/p&gt;

If it is programmatic access, you need MySQL Connector/NET, this provides ADO.NET driver for MySQL/MariaDB. If you want to administer MariaDB from VB Express IDE, there is no way to do it, and HeidiSQL or similar GUI clients  is the  best option.&lt;/p&gt;
