Just looking for ammo to justify why we're using what may be an out of support release when the time comes. Looking forward to10.11.&lt;/p&gt;

The 10.11 alpha is scheduled for mid-September, and you can get a rough idea of when a GA release could be by looking at the progress of previous releases, for example &lt;a href="/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-107/#list-of-all-mariadb-107-releases"&gt;10.7&lt;/a&gt;, which moved from alpha in September to GA in February. Treat this as no more than optimistic estimate, as there may be delays and intermediate releases if more issues are found.&lt;/p&gt;

Good to know about 10.11 but, considering that it's not even in Alpha test from what I can tell, is there any idea how far past February it might be before it goes GA?&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/downgrading-between-major-versions-of-mariadb/"&gt;Downgrading between Major Versions of MariaDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-1011/"&gt;MariaDB 10.11&lt;/a&gt; is probably going to be an LTS, but that is unlikely to be generally available by February, so your best bet is either to stick with 10.7 beyond EOL, or upgrade to an intermediate version.&lt;/p&gt;
