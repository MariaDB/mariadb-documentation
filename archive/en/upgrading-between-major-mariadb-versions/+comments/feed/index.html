You should be able to trivially upgrade from ANY earlier MariaDB version to the latest one (for example &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5&lt;/a&gt;.x to &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-105/"&gt;MariaDB 10.5&lt;/a&gt;.x), usually in a few seconds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, it doesn't seem that way to me. I came to this page wanting to know how to upgrade to the latest version. I am currently on 10.3 and want to go to 10.5. I just want a list of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step given is "Upgrade MariaDB binaries and libraries, preferably without starting MariaDB". No link, no further instructions. This is what I want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I search around, all I can find is a page about upgrading from 10.4 to 10.5 - &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-104-to-mariadb-105/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-104-to-mariadb-105/&lt;/a&gt;. This tells me I need to manually update an apt repository. Is this what I need? How can I tell? If it is, it does not in my mind make for a "trivial" or "easy" upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
