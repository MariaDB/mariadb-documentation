&lt;p&gt;In general, for any upgrade for a critical production environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best approach is to use or create a test environment that is as close as possible to your production environment and test the upgrade there.
Make backups and prepare a rollback so you are ready to undo your changes
For MariaDB specifically: to quote from other related questions on their support pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main concern with skipping versions is that, while upgrading one major version is usually well-tested, skipping versions is not, so you may bump into an incompatibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you find anecdotal indications that it worked for others, a database engine like MariaDB has possible complexities with different storage engines and the like that might make it more tricky in certain setups than in others.
