<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>MariaDB Monitor monitors a Primary-Replica replication cluster. It probes the
state of the backends and assigns server roles such as primary and replica, which
are used by the routers when deciding where to route a query. It can also modify
the replication cluster by performing failover, switchover and rejoin. Backend
server versions older than MariaDB/MySQL 5.5 are not supported. Failover and
other similar operations require MariaDB 10.0.2 or later.</p>
<p>Up until MariaDB MaxScale 2.2.0, this monitor was called <em>MySQL Monitor</em>.</p>
<h2 id="required-grants">Required Grants</h2>
<p>The monitor user requires the following grant:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>CREATE USER 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost' IDENTIFIED BY 'maxscale-password';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>In MariaDB Server versions 10.5.0 to 10.5.8, the monitor user instead requires
REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>In MariaDB Server 10.5.9 and later, REPLICA MONITOR is required:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT REPLICA MONITOR ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>If the monitor needs to query server disk space (i.e. <code>disk_space_threshold</code> is
set), then the FILE-grant is required with MariaDB Server versions 10.4.7,
10.3.17, 10.2.26 and 10.1.41 and later.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT FILE ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>MariaDB Server 10.5.2 introduces CONNECTION ADMIN. This is recommended since it
allows the monitor to log in even if server connection limit has been reached.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT CONNECTION ADMIN ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<h3 id="cluster-manipulation-grants">Cluster Manipulation Grants</h3>
<p>If <a href="#cluster-manipulation-operations">cluster manipulation operations</a> are used,
the following additional grants are required:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT SUPER, RELOAD, PROCESS, SHOW DATABASES, EVENT ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>MariaDB 10.5.2 and later require read access to <em>mysql.global_priv</em>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT SELECT ON mysql.global_priv TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>As of MariaDB Server 11.0.1, the SUPER-privilege no longer contains several of
its former sub-privileges. These must be given separately.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>GRANT RELOAD, PROCESS, SHOW DATABASES, EVENT, SET USER, READ_ONLY ADMIN ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN, BINLOG ADMIN, CONNECTION ADMIN ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.global_priv TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
</pre></div>


<p>If a separate replication user is defined (with <code>replication_user</code> and
<code>replication_password</code>), it requires the following grant:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>CREATE USER 'replication'@'replicationhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'replication-password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replication'@'replicationhost';
</pre></div>


<h2 id="primary-selection">Primary selection</h2>
<p>Only one backend can be primary at any given time. A primary must be running
(successfully connected to by the monitor) and its <em>read_only</em>-setting must be
off. A primary may not be replicating from another server in the monitored
cluster unless the primary is part of a multiprimary group. Primary selection
prefers to select the server with the most replicas, possibly in multiple
replication layers. Only replicas reachable by a chain of running relays or
directly connected to the primary count.  When multiple servers are tied for
primary status, the server which appears earlier in the <code>servers</code>-setting of the
monitor is selected.</p>
<p>Servers in a cyclical replication topology (multiprimary group) are interpreted
as having all the servers in the group as replicas. Even from a multiprimary group
only one server is selected as the overall primary.</p>
<p>After a primary has been selected, the monitor prefers to stick with the choice
even if other potential primaries with more replica servers are available. Only if
the current primary is clearly unsuitable does the monitor try to select another
primary. An existing primary turns invalid if:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is unwritable (<em>read_only</em> is on).</li>
<li>It has been down for more than <em>failcount</em> monitor passes and has no running
replicas. Running replicas behind a downed relay count. A replica in this
context is any server with at least a partially running replication connection
(either io or sql thread is running). The replicas must also be down for more
than <em>failcount</em> monitor passes to allow new master selection.</li>
<li>It did not previously replicate from another server in the cluster but it
is now replicating.</li>
<li>It was previously part of a multiprimary group but is no longer, or the
multiprimary group is replicating from a server not in the group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cases 1 and 2 cover the situations in which the DBA, an external script or even
another MaxScale has modified the cluster such that the old primary can no longer
act as primary. Cases 3 and 4 are less severe. In these cases the topology has
changed significantly and the primary should be re-selected, although the old
primary may still be the best choice.</p>
<p>The primary change described above is different from failover and switchover
described in section
<a href="#failover,-switchover-and-auto-rejoin">Failover, switchover and auto-rejoin</a>.
A primary change only modifies the server roles inside MaxScale but does not
modify the cluster other than changing the targets of read and write queries.
Failover and switchover perform a primary change on their own.</p>
<p>As a general rule, it's best to avoid situations where the cluster has multiple
standalone servers, separate primary-replica pairs or separate multiprimary groups.
Due to primary invalidation rule 2, a standalone primary can easily lose the
primary status to another valid primary if it goes down. The new primary probably
does not have the same data as the previous one. Non-standalone primaries are less
vulnerable, as a single running replica or multiprimary group member will keep the
primary valid even when down.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>A minimal configuration for a  monitor requires a set of servers for monitoring
and a username and a password to connect to these servers.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>[MyMonitor]
type=monitor
module=mariadbmon
servers=server1,server2,server3
user=myuser
password=mypwd
</pre></div>


<p>From MaxScale 2.2.1 onwards, the module name is <code>mariadbmon</code> instead of
<code>mysqlmon</code>. The old name can still be used.</p>
<p>The grants required by <code>user</code> depend on which monitor features are used.  A full
list of the grants can be found in the <a href="#required-grants">Required Grants</a>
section.</p>
<h2 id="common-monitor-parameters">Common Monitor Parameters</h2>
<p>For a list of optional parameters that all monitors support, read the
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/">Monitor Common</a> document.</p>
<h2 id="mariadb-monitor-optional-parameters">MariaDB Monitor optional parameters</h2>
<p>These are optional parameters specific to the MariaDB Monitor. Failover,
switchover and rejoin-specific parameters are listed in their own
<a href="#cluster-manipulation-operations">section</a>. Rebuild-related parameters are
described in the <a href="#rebuild-server">Rebuild server-section</a>. ColumnStore
parameters are described in the <a href="#settings">ColumnStore commands-section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="assume_unique_hostnames"><code>assume_unique_hostnames</code></h3>
<p>Boolean, default: ON. When active, the monitor assumes that server hostnames and
ports are consistent between the server definitions in the MaxScale
configuration file  and the "SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS" outputs of the servers
themselves. Specifically, the monitor assumes that if server A is replicating
from server B, then A must have a replica connection with <code>Master_Host</code> and
<code>Master_Port</code> equal to B's address and port in the configuration file. If this
is not the case, e.g. an IP is used in the server while a hostname is given in
the file, the monitor may misinterpret the topology. In MaxScale 2.4.1, the
monitor attempts name resolution on the addresses if a simple string comparison
does not find a match. Using exact matching addresses is, however, more
reliable.</p>
<p>This setting must be ON to use any cluster operation features such as failover
or switchover, because MaxScale uses the addresses and ports in the
configuration file when issuing "CHANGE MASTER TO"-commands.</p>
<p>If the network configuration is such that the addresses MaxScale uses to connect
to backends are different from the ones the servers use to connect to each
other, <code>assume_unique_hostnames</code> should be set to OFF. In this mode, MaxScale
uses server id:s it queries from the servers and the <code>Master_Server_Id</code> fields
of the replica connections to deduce which server is replicating from which. This
is not perfect though, since MaxScale doesn't know the id:s of servers it has
never connected to (e.g. server has been down since MaxScale was started). Also,
the <code>Master_Server_Id</code>-field may have an incorrect value if the replica connection
has not been established. MaxScale will only trust the value if the monitor has
seen the replica connection IO thread connected at least once. If this is not the
case, the replica connection is ignored.</p>
<h3 id="master_conditions"><code>master_conditions</code></h3>
<p>Enum, default: <em>primary_monitor_master, disk_space_ok</em>. Designate additional
conditions for <em>Master</em>-status, i.e qualified for read and write queries.</p>
<p>Normally, if a suitable primary candidate server is found as described in
<a href="#primary-selection">Primary selection</a>, MaxScale designates it <em>Master</em>.
<em>master_conditions</em> sets additional conditions for a primary server. This
setting is an enum, allowing multiple conditions to be set simultaneously.
Conditions 2, 3 and 4 refer to replica servers. A single replica must
fulfill all of the given conditions for the primary to be viable.</p>
<p>If the primary candidate fails <em>master_conditions</em> but fulfills
<em>slave_conditions</em>, it may be designated <em>Slave</em> instead.</p>
<p>The available conditions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>none : No additional conditions</li>
<li>connecting_slave : At least one immediate replica (not behind relay) is
attempting to replicate or is replicating from the primary (Slave_IO_Running is
'Yes' or 'Connecting', Slave_SQL_Running is 'Yes'). A replica with incorrect
replication credentials does not count. If the replica is currently down, results
from the last successful monitor tick are used.</li>
<li>connected_slave : Same as above, with the difference that the replication
connection must be up (Slave_IO_Running is 'Yes'). If the replica is currently
down, results from the last successful monitor tick are used.</li>
<li>running_slave : Same as <em>connecting_slave</em>, with the addition that the
replica must also be <em>Running</em>.</li>
<li>primary_monitor_master : If this MaxScale is
<a href="#cooperative-monitoring">cooperating</a> with another MaxScale and this is the
secondary MaxScale, require that the candidate primary is selected also by the
primary MaxScale.</li>
<li>disk_space_ok : The candidate primary must not be low on disk space. This
option only takes effect if
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/#disk_space_threshold">disk space check</a> is enabled. Added in
MaxScale 23.08.5.</li>
</ol>
<p>The default value of this setting is
<code>master_requirements=primary_monitor_master,disk_space_ok</code> to ensure that both
monitors use the same primary server when cooperating and that the primary is
not out of disk space.</p>
<p>For example, to require that the primary must have a replica which is both
connected and running, set</p>
<div><pre><span></span>master_conditions=connected_slave,running_slave
</pre></div>


<h3 id="slave_conditions"><code>slave_conditions</code></h3>
<p>Enum, default: <em>none</em>. Designate additional conditions for <em>Slave</em>-status,
i.e qualified for read queries.</p>
<p>Normally, a server is <em>Slave</em> if it is at least attempting to replicate from the
primary candidate or a relay (Slave_IO_Running is 'Yes' or 'Connecting',
Slave_SQL_Running is 'Yes', valid replication credentials). The primary candidate
does not necessarily need to be writable, e.g. if it fails its
<em>master_conditions</em>. <em>slave_conditions</em> sets additional conditions for a replica
server. This setting is an enum, allowing multiple conditions to be set
simultaneously.</p>
<p>The available conditions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>none : No additional conditions. This is the default value.</li>
<li>linked_master : The replica must be connected to the primary (Slave_IO_Running
and Slave_SQL_Running are 'Yes') and the primary must be <em>Running</em>. The same
applies to any relays between the replica and the primary.</li>
<li>running_master : The primary must be running. Relays may be down.</li>
<li>writable_master : The primary must be writable, i.e. labeled <em>Master</em>.</li>
<li>primary_monitor_master : If this MaxScale is
<a href="#cooperative-monitoring">cooperating</a> with another MaxScale and this is the
secondary MaxScale, require that the candidate primary is selected also by the
primary MaxScale.</li>
<li>disk_space_ok : The replica must not be low on disk space. This
option only takes effect if
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/#disk_space_threshold">disk space check</a> is enabled. Added in
MaxScale 23.08.5.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, to require that the primary server of the cluster must be running
and writable for any servers to have <em>Slave</em>-status, set</p>
<div><pre><span></span>slave_conditions=running_master,writable_master
</pre></div>


<h3 id="failcount"><code>failcount</code></h3>
<p>Number of consecutive monitor passes a primary server must be down before it is
considered failed. If automatic failover is enabled (<code>auto_failover=true</code>), it
may be performed at this time. A value of 0 or 1 enables immediate failover.</p>
<p>If automatic failover is not possible, the monitor will try to
search for another server to fulfill the primary role. See section
<a href="#primary-selection">Primary selection</a>
for more details. Changing the primary may break replication as queries could be
routed to a server without previous events. To prevent this, avoid having
multiple valid primary servers in the cluster.</p>
<p>The default value is 5 failures.</p>
<p>The worst-case delay between the primary failure and the start of the failover
can be estimated by summing up the timeout values and <code>monitor_interval</code> and
multiplying that by <code>failcount</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>(monitor_interval + backend_connect_timeout) * failcount
</pre></div>


<h3 id="enforce_writable_master"><code>enforce_writable_master</code></h3>
<p>This feature is disabled by default. If set to ON, the monitor attempts to
disable the <em>read_only</em>-flag on the primary when seen. The flag is
checked every monitor tick. The monitor user requires the SUPER-privilege for
this feature to work.</p>
<p>Typically, the primary server should never be in read-only-mode. Such a situation
may arise due to misconfiguration or accident, or perhaps if MaxScale crashed
during switchover.</p>
<p>When this feature is enabled, setting the primary manually to <em>read_only</em> will no
longer cause the monitor to search for another primary. The primary will instead
for a moment lose its [Master]-status (no writes), until the monitor again
enables writes on the primary. When starting from scratch, the monitor still
prefers to select a writable server as primary if possible.</p>
<h3 id="enforce_read_only_slaves"><code>enforce_read_only_slaves</code></h3>
<p>This feature is disabled by default. If set to ON, the monitor attempts to
enable the <em>read_only</em>-flag on any writable replica server. The flag is checked
every monitor tick. The monitor user requires the SUPER-privilege
(or READ_ONLY ADMIN) for this
feature to work. While the <em>read_only</em>-flag is ON, only users with the
SUPER-privilege (or READ_ONLY ADMIN) can write to the backend server. If
temporary write access is required, this feature should be disabled before
attempting to disable <em>read_only</em> manually. Otherwise, the monitor will quickly
re-enable it.</p>
<p><em>read_only</em> won't be enabled on the master server, even if it has
lost [Master]-status due to <a href="#master_conditions">master_conditions</a> and is
marked [Slave].</p>
<h3 id="enforce_read_only_servers"><code>enforce_read_only_servers</code></h3>
<p>Boolean, default: false. Works similar to
<a href="#enforce_read_only_slaves">enforce_read_only_slaves</a> except will set
<em>read_only</em> on any writable server that is not the primary and not in
maintenance (a superset of the servers altered by <em>enforce_read_only_slaves</em>).</p>
<p>The monitor user requires the SUPER-privilege
(or READ_ONLY ADMIN) for this feature to work. If the cluster has no valid
primary or primary candidate, <em>read_only</em> is not set on any server as it is
unclear which servers should be altered.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance_on_low_disk_space"><code>maintenance_on_low_disk_space</code></h3>
<p>This feature is enabled by default. If a running server that is not the primary
or a relay primary is out of disk space the server is set to maintenance mode.
Such servers are not used for router sessions and are ignored when performing a
failover or other cluster modification operation. See the general monitor
parameters <a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/#disk_space_threshold">disk_space_threshold</a> and
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/#disk_space_check_interval">disk_space_check_interval</a>
on how to enable disk space monitoring.</p>
<p>Once a server has been put to maintenance mode, the disk space situation
of that server is no longer updated. The server will not be taken out of
maintenance mode even if more disk space becomes available. The maintenance
flag must be removed manually:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl clear server server2 Maint
</pre></div>


<h3 id="cooperative_monitoring_locks"><code>cooperative_monitoring_locks</code></h3>
<p>Using this setting is recommended when multiple MaxScales are monitoring the
same backend cluster. When enabled, the monitor attempts to acquire exclusive
locks on the backend servers. The monitor considers itself the primary monitor
if it has a majority of locks. The majority can be either over all configured
servers or just over running servers. See
<a href="#cooperative-monitoring">Cooperative monitoring</a>
for more details on how this feature works and which value to use.</p>
<p>Allowed values:
1. <code>none</code> Default value, no locking.
2. <code>majority_of_all</code> Primary monitor requires majority of locks, even counting
servers which are [Down].
3. <code>majority_of_running</code> Primary monitor requires majority of locks over
[Running] servers.</p>
<p>This setting is separate from the global MaxScale setting <em>passive</em>. If
<em>passive</em> is set, cluster operations are disabled even if monitor has
acquired the locks. Generally, it's best not to mix cooperative monitoring with
the <em>passive</em>-setting.</p>
<h3 id="script_max_replication_lag"><code>script_max_replication_lag</code></h3>
<p>Integer, default: -1. Defines a replication lag limit in seconds for
launching the monitor script configured in the <em>script</em>-parameter. If the
replication lag of a server goes above this limit, the script is ran with the
$EVENT-placeholder replaced by "rlag_above". If the lag goes back below the
limit, the script is ran again with replacement "rlag_below".</p>
<p>Negative values disable this feature. For more information on monitor scripts,
see <a href="./node:mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters#script">general monitor documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cluster-manipulation-operations">Cluster manipulation operations</h2>
<p>Starting with MaxScale 2.2.1, MariaDB Monitor supports replication cluster
modification. The operations implemented are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>failover</em>, which replaces a failed primary with a replica</li>
<li><em>switchover</em>, which swaps a running primary with a replica</li>
<li><em>switchover_force</em>, which swaps a running primary with a replica, ignoring
  most errors</li>
<li><em>async-switchover</em>, which schedules a switchover and returns</li>
<li><em>rejoin</em>, which directs servers to replicate from the primary</li>
<li><em>reset-replication</em> (added in MaxScale 2.3.0), which deletes binary logs and
resets gtid:s</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="#operation-details">operation details</a> for more information on the
implementation of the commands.</p>
<p>The cluster operations require that the monitor user (<code>user</code>) has the following
privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li>SUPER, to modify replica connections, set globals such as <em>read_only</em> and kill
connections from other super-users</li>
<li>REPLICATION CLIENT (REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN in MariaDB Server 10.5), to list
replica connections</li>
<li>RELOAD, to flush binary logs</li>
<li>PROCESS, to check if the <em>event_scheduler</em> process is running</li>
<li>SHOW DATABASES and EVENT, to list and modify server events</li>
<li>SELECT on mysql.user, to see which users have SUPER</li>
<li>SELECT on mysql.global_priv so see to see which users have READ_ONLY ADMIN</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of the grants can be found in the <a href="#required-grants">Required Grants</a>
section.</p>
<p>The privilege system was changed in MariaDB Server 10.5. The effects of this on
the MaxScale monitor user are minor, as the SUPER-privilege contains many of the
required privileges and is still required to kill connections from other
super-users.</p>
<p>In MariaDB Server 11.0.1 and later, SUPER no longer contains all the required
grants. The monitor requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>READ_ONLY ADMIN, to set <em>read_only</em></li>
<li>REPLICA MONITOR and REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN, to view and manage replication
connections</li>
<li>RELOAD, to flush binary logs</li>
<li>PROCESS, to check if the <em>event_scheduler</em> process is running</li>
<li>SHOW DATABASES, EVENT and SET USER, to list and modify server events</li>
<li>BINLOG ADMIN, to delete binary logs (during <em>reset-replication</em>)</li>
<li>CONNECTION ADMIN, to kill connections</li>
<li>SELECT on mysql.user, to see which users have SUPER</li>
<li>SELECT on mysql.global_priv so see to see which users have READ_ONLY ADMIN</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the monitor needs to know which username and password a
replica should use when starting replication. These are given in
<code>replication_user</code> and <code>replication_password</code>.</p>
<p>The user can define files with SQL statements which are executed on any server
being demoted or promoted by cluster manipulation commands. See the sections on
<code>promotion_sql_file</code> and <code>demotion_sql_file</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The monitor can manipulate scheduled server events when promoting or demoting a
server. See the section on <code>handle_events</code> for more information.</p>
<p>All cluster operations can be activated manually through MaxCtrl. See
section <a href="#manual-activation">Manual activation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>See <a href="#limitations-and-requirements">Limitations and requirements</a> for
information on possible issues with failover and switchover.</p>
<h3 id="operation-details">Operation details</h3>
<p><strong>Failover</strong> replaces a failed primary with a running replica. It does the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the most up-to-date replica of the old primary to be the new primary. The
selection criteria is as follows in descending priority:<ol>
<li>gtid_IO_pos (latest event in relay log)</li>
<li>gtid_current_pos (most processed events)</li>
<li>log_slave_updates is on</li>
<li>disk space is not low</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the new primary has unprocessed relay log items, cancel and try again
later.</li>
<li>Prepare the new primary:<ol>
<li>Remove the replica connection the new primary used to replicate from the
  old primary.</li>
<li>Disable the <em>read_only</em>-flag.</li>
<li>Enable scheduled server events (if event handling is on). Only events
  that were enabled on the old primary are enabled.</li>
<li>Run the commands in <code>promotion_sql_file</code>.</li>
<li>Start replication from external primary if one existed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Redirect all other replicas to replicate from the new primary:<ol>
<li>STOP SLAVE and RESET SLAVE</li>
<li>CHANGE MASTER TO</li>
<li>START SLAVE</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Check that all replicas are replicating.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failover is considered successful if steps 1 to 3 succeed, as the cluster then
has at least a valid primary server.</p>
<p><strong>Switchover</strong> swaps a running primary with a running replica. It does the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the old primary for demotion:<ol>
<li>If <code>backend_read_timeout</code> is short, extend it and reconnect.</li>
<li>Stop any external replication.</li>
<li>Enable the <em>read_only</em>-flag to stop writes from normal users.</li>
<li>Kill connections from super and read-only admin users since
     <em>read_only</em> does not affect them. During this step, all writes are
     blocked with "FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK".</li>
<li>Disable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).</li>
<li>Run the commands in <code>demotion_sql_file</code>.</li>
<li>Flush the binary log ("flush logs") so that all events are on disk.</li>
<li>Wait a moment to check that gtid is stable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Wait for the new primary to catch up with the old primary.</li>
<li>Promote new primary and redirect replicas as in failover steps 3 and 4. Also
redirect the demoted old primary.</li>
<li>Check that all replicas are replicating.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similar to failover, switchover is considered successful if the new primary was
successfully promoted.</p>
<p><strong>Switchover-force</strong> performs the same steps as a normal switchover but ignores
any errors on the old primary. Switchover-force also does not expect the new
primary to reach the gtid-position of the old, as the old primary
could be receiving more events constantly. Thus, switchover-force may lose
events.</p>
<p><strong>Rejoin</strong> joins a standalone server to the cluster or redirects a replica
replicating from a server other than the primary. A standalone server is joined
by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the commands in <code>demotion_sql_file</code>.</li>
<li>Enable the <em>read_only</em>-flag.</li>
<li>Disable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).</li>
<li>Start replication: CHANGE MASTER TO and START SLAVE.</li>
</ol>
<p>A server which is replicating from the wrong primary is redirected simply with
STOP SLAVE, RESET SLAVE, CHANGE MASTER TO and START SLAVE commands.</p>
<p><strong>Reset-replication</strong> (added in MaxScale 2.3.0) deletes binary logs and resets
gtid:s. This destructive command is meant for situations where the gtid:s in the
cluster are out of sync while the actual data is known to be in sync. The
operation  proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reset gtid:s and delete binary logs on all servers:<ol>
<li>Stop (STOP SLAVE) and delete (RESET SLAVE ALL) all replica connections.</li>
<li>Enable the <em>read_only</em>-flag.</li>
<li>Disable scheduled server events (if event handling is on).</li>
<li>Delete binary logs (RESET MASTER).</li>
<li>Set the sequence number of <em>gtid_slave_pos</em> to zero. This also affects
 <em>gtid_current_pos</em>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Prepare new primary:<ol>
<li>Disable the <em>read_only</em>-flag.</li>
<li>Enable scheduled server events (if event handling is on). Events are
  only enabled if the cluster had a primary server when starting the
  reset-replication operation. Only events that were enabled on the previous
  primary are enabled on the new.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Direct other servers to replicate from the new primary as in the other
operations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="manual-activation">Manual activation</h3>
<p>Cluster operations can be activated manually through the REST API or MaxCtrl.
The commands are only performed when MaxScale is in active mode. The commands
generally match their automatic versions. The exception is <em>rejoin</em>, in which
the manual command allows rejoining even when the joining server has empty
gtid:s. This rule allows the user to force a rejoin on a server without binary
logs.</p>
<p>All commands require the monitor instance name as the first parameter. Failover
selects the new primary server automatically and does not require additional
parameters. Rejoin requires the name of the joining server as second parameter.
Replication reset accepts the name of the new primary server as second parameter.
If not given, the current primary is selected.</p>
<p>Switchover takes one to three parameters. If only the monitor name is given,
switchover will autoselect both the replica to promote and the current primary as
the server to be demoted. If two parameters are given, the second parameter is
interpreted as the replica to promote. If three parameters are given, the third
parameter is interpreted as the current primary. The user-given current primary is
compared to the primary server currently deduced by the monitor and if the two
are unequal, an error is given.</p>
<p>Example commands are below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl call command mariadbmon failover MyMonitor
maxctrl call command mariadbmon rejoin MyMonitor OldPrimaryServ
maxctrl call command mariadbmon reset-replication MyMonitor
maxctrl call command mariadbmon reset-replication MyMonitor NewPrimaryServ
maxctrl call command mariadbmon switchover MyMonitor
maxctrl call command mariadbmon switchover MyMonitor NewPrimaryServ
maxctrl call command mariadbmon switchover MyMonitor NewPrimaryServ OldPrimaryServ
maxctrl call command mariadbmon switchover-force MyMonitor NewPrimaryServ
</pre></div>


<p>The commands follow the standard module command syntax. All require the monitor
configuration name (MyMonitor) as the first parameter. For switchover, the
last two parameters define the server to promote (NewPrimaryServ) and the server
to demote (OldPrimaryServ). For rejoin, the server to join (OldPrimaryServ) is
required. Replication reset requires the server to promote (NewPrimaryServ).</p>
<p>It is safe to perform manual operations even with automatic failover, switchover
or rejoin enabled since automatic operations cannot happen simultaneously
with manual ones.</p>
<p>When a cluster modification is initiated via the REST-API, the URL path is of the
form:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/&lt;operation&gt;?&lt;monitor-name&gt;&amp;&lt;server-name1&gt;&amp;&lt;server-name2&gt;
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li><code>&lt;operation&gt;</code> is the name of the command e.g. <em>failover</em>, <em>switchover</em>,
  <em>rejoin</em> or <em>reset-replication</em>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;monitor-name&gt;</code> is the monitor name from the MaxScale configuration file.</li>
<li><code>&lt;server-name1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;server-name2&gt;</code> are server names as described
above for MaxCtrl. Only <em>switchover</em> accepts both, <em>failover</em> doesn't need any
and both <em>rejoin</em> and <em>reset-replication</em> accept one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a MaxScale configuration file like</p>
<div><pre><span></span>[Cluster1]
type=monitor
module=mariadbmon
servers=server1, server2, server3, server 4
...
</pre></div>


<p>with the assumption that <code>server2</code> is the current primary, then the URL
path for making <code>server4</code> the new primary would be:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/switchover?Cluster1&amp;server4&amp;server2
</pre></div>


<p>Example REST-API paths for other commands are listed below.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/failover?Cluster1
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/rejoin?Cluster1&amp;server3
/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/reset-replication?Cluster1&amp;server3
</pre></div>


<h4 id="queued-switchover">Queued switchover</h4>
<p>Most cluster modification commands wait until the operation either succeeds or
fails. <em>async-switchover</em> is an exception, as it returns immediately. Otherwise
<em>async-switchover</em> works identical to a normal <em>switchover</em> command. Use the
module command <em>fetch-cmd-result</em> to view the result of the queued command.
<em>fetch-cmd-result</em> returns the status or result of the latest manual command,
whether queued or not.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl call command mariadbmon async-switchover Cluster1
OK
maxctrl call command mariadbmon fetch-cmd-result Cluster1
{
    "links": {
        "self": "http://localhost:8989/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/fetch-cmd-result"
    },
    "meta": "switchover completed successfully."
}
</pre></div>


<h3 id="automatic-activation">Automatic activation</h3>
<p>Failover can activate automatically if <code>auto_failover</code> is on. The activation
begins when the primary has been down at least <code>failcount</code> monitor iterations.
Before modifying the cluster, the monitor checks that all prerequisites for the
failover are fulfilled. If the cluster does not seem ready, an error is printed
and the cluster is rechecked during the next monitor iteration.</p>
<p>Switchover can also activate automatically with the
<code>switchover_on_low_disk_space</code>-setting. The operation begins if the primary
server is low on disk space but otherwise the operating logic is quite similar
to automatic failover.</p>
<p>Rejoin stands for starting replication on a standalone server or redirecting a
replica replicating from the wrong primary (any server that is not the cluster
primary). The rejoined servers are directed to replicate from the current cluster
primary server, forcing the replication topology to a 1-primary-N-replicas
configuration.</p>
<p>A server is categorized as standalone if the server has no replica connections,
not even stopped ones. A server is replicating from the wrong primary if the
replica IO thread is connected but the primary server id seen by the replica does not
match the cluster primary id. Alternatively, the IO thread may be stopped or
connecting but the primary server host or port information differs from the
cluster primary info. These criteria mean that a STOP SLAVE does not yet set a
replica as standalone.</p>
<p>With <code>auto_rejoin</code> active, the monitor will try to rejoin any servers matching
the above requirements. Rejoin does not obey <code>failcount</code> and will attempt to
rejoin any valid servers immediately. When activating rejoin manually, the
user-designated server must fulfill the same requirements.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-and-requirements">Limitations and requirements</h3>
<p>Switchover and failover are meant for simple topologies (one primary and
several replicas). Using these commands with complicated topologies
(multiple primaries, relays, circular replication) may give unpredictable results
and should be tested before use on a production system.</p>
<p>The server cluster is assumed to be well-behaving with no significant
replication lag (within <code>failover_timeout</code>/<code>switchover_timeout</code>) and all
commands that modify the cluster (such as "STOP SLAVE", "CHANGE MASTER",
"START SLAVE") complete in a few seconds (faster than <code>backend_read_timeout</code>
and <code>backend_write_timeout</code>).</p>
<p>The backends must all use GTID-based replication, and the domain id should not
change during a switchover or failover. Replicas should not have extra
local events so that GTIDs are compatible across the cluster.</p>
<p>Failover cannot be performed if MaxScale was started only after the primary
server went down. This is because MaxScale needs reliable information on the
gtid domain of the cluster and the replication topology in general to properly
select the new primary. <code>enforce_simple_topology=1</code> relaxes this requirement.</p>
<p>Failover may lose events. If a primary goes down before sending new events to at
least one replica, those events are lost when a new primary is chosen. If the old
primary comes back online, the other servers have likely moved on with a
diverging history and the old primary can no longer join the replication cluster.</p>
<p>To reduce the chance of losing data, use
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/semisynchronous-replication/">semisynchronous replication</a>.
In semisynchronous mode, the primary waits for a replica to receive an event before
returning an acknowledgement to the client. This does not yet guarantee a clean
failover. If the primary fails after preparing a transaction but before receiving
replica acknowledgement, it will still commit the prepared transaction as part of
its crash recovery. If the replicas never saw this transaction, the
old primary has diverged from the cluster. See
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/semisynchronous-replication/#configuring-the-master-wait-point">Configuring the Master Wait Point</a>
for more information. This situation is much less likely in MariaDB Server
10.6.2 and later, as the improved crash recovery logic will delete such
transactions.</p>
<p>Even a controlled shutdown of the primary may lose events. The server does not by
default wait for all data to be replicated to the replicas when shutting down and
instead simply closes all connections. Before shutting down the primary with the
intention of having a replica promoted, run <em>switchover</em> first to ensure that all
data is replicated. For more information on server shutdown, see
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/replication-threads/#binary-log-dump-threads-and-the-shutdown-process">Binary Log Dump Threads and the Shutdown Process</a>.</p>
<p>Switchover requires that the cluster is "frozen" for the duration of the
operation. This means that no data modifying statements such as INSERT or UPDATE
are executed and the GTID position of the primary server is stable. When
switchover begins, the monitor sets the global <em>read_only</em> flag on the old
primary backend to stop any updates. <em>read_only</em> does not affect users with the
SUPER-privilege so any such user can issue writes during a switchover. These
writes have a high chance of breaking replication, because the write may not be
replicated to all replicas before they switch to the new primary. To prevent this,
any users who commonly do updates should NOT have the SUPER-privilege. For even
more security, the only SUPER-user session during a switchover should be the
MaxScale monitor user. This also applies to users running scheduled server
events. Although the monitor by default disables events on the master, an
event may already be executing. If the event definer has SUPER-privilege, the
event can write to the database even through <em>read_only</em>.</p>
<p>When mixing rejoin with failover/switchover, the backends should have
<em>log_slave_updates</em> on. The rejoining server is likely lagging behind the rest
of the cluster. If the current cluster primary does not have binary logs from the
moment the rejoining server lost connection, the rejoining server cannot
continue replication. This is an issue if the primary has changed and
the new primary does not have <em>log_slave_updates</em> on.</p>
<p>If an automatic cluster operation such as auto-failover or auto-rejoin fails,
all cluster modifying operations are disabled for <code>failcount</code> monitor iterations,
after which the operation may be retried. Similar logic applies if the cluster is
unsuitable for such operations, e.g. replication is not using GTID.</p>
<h3 id="external-primary-support">External primary support</h3>
<p>The monitor detects if a server in the cluster is replicating from an external
primary (a server that is not monitored by the monitor). If the replicating
server is the cluster primary server, then the cluster itself is considered to
have an external primary.</p>
<p>If a failover/switchover happens, the new primary server is set to replicate from
the cluster external primary server. The username and password for the replication
are defined in <code>replication_user</code> and <code>replication_password</code>. The address and
port used are the ones shown by <code>SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS</code> on the old cluster
primary server. In the case of switchover, the old primary also stops replicating
from the external server to preserve the topology.</p>
<p>After failover the new primary is replicating from the external primary. If the
failed old primary comes back online, it is also replicating from the external
server. To normalize the situation, either have <em>auto_rejoin</em> on or manually
execute a rejoin. This will redirect the old primary to the current cluster
primary.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-parameters">Configuration parameters</h3>
<h4 id="auto_failover"><code>auto_failover</code></h4>
<p>Enable automated primary failover. This parameter expects a boolean value and the
default value is false.</p>
<p>When automatic failover is enabled, traditional MariaDB Primary-Replica clusters
will automatically elect a new primary if the old primary goes down and stays down
a number of iterations given in <code>failcount</code>. Failover will not take place when
MaxScale is configured as a passive instance. For details on how MaxScale
behaves in passive mode, see the documentation on <code>failover_timeout</code> below.</p>
<p>The monitor user must have the SUPER and RELOAD privileges for failover to work.</p>
<h4 id="auto_rejoin"><code>auto_rejoin</code></h4>
<p>Enable automatic joining of server to the cluster. This parameter expects a
boolean value and the default value is false.</p>
<p>When enabled, the monitor will attempt to direct standalone servers and servers
replicating from a relay primary to the main cluster primary server, enforcing a
1-primary-N-replicas configuration.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following event series.</p>
<ol>
<li>Replica A goes down</li>
<li>Primary goes down and a failover is performed, promoting Replica B</li>
<li>Replica A comes back</li>
</ol>
<p>Replica A is still trying to replicate from the downed primary, since it wasn't
online during failover. If <code>auto_rejoin</code> is on, Replica A will quickly be
redirected to Replica B, the current primary.</p>
<h4 id="switchover_on_low_disk_space"><code>switchover_on_low_disk_space</code></h4>
<p>This feature is disabled by default. If enabled, the monitor will attempt to
switchover a primary server low on disk space with a replica. The switch is only
done if a replica without disk space issues is found. If
<code>maintenance_on_low_disk_space</code> is also enabled, the old primary (now a replica)
will be put to maintenance during the next monitor iteration.</p>
<p>For this parameter to have any effect, <code>disk_space_threshold</code> must be specified
for the <a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide/#disk_space_threshold">server</a>
or the <a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/#disk_space_threshold">monitor</a>.
Also, <a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-common-monitor-parameters/#disk_space_check_interval">disk_space_check_interval</a>
must be defined for the monitor.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>switchover_on_low_disk_space=true
</pre></div>


<h4 id="enforce_simple_topology"><code>enforce_simple_topology</code></h4>
<p>This setting tells the monitor to assume that the servers should be arranged in a
1-primary-N-replicas topology and the monitor should try to keep it that way. If
<code>enforce_simple_topology</code> is enabled, the settings <code>assume_unique_hostnames</code>,
<code>auto_failover</code> and <code>auto_rejoin</code> are also activated regardless of their individual
settings.</p>
<p>By default, mariadbmon will not rejoin servers with more than one replication
stream configured into the cluster. Starting with MaxScale 6.2.0, when
<code>enforce_simple_topology</code> is enabled, all servers will be rejoined into the
cluster and any extra replication sources will be removed. This is done to make
automated failover with multi-source external replication possible.</p>
<p>This setting also allows the monitor to perform a failover to a cluster where the primary
server has not been seen [Running]. This is usually the case when the primary goes down
before MaxScale is started. When using this feature, the monitor will guess the GTID
domain id of the primary from the replicas. For reliable results, the GTID:s of the cluster
should be simple.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>enforce_simple_topology=true
</pre></div>


<h4 id="replication_user-and-replication_password"><code>replication_user</code> and <code>replication_password</code></h4>
<p>The username and password of the replication user. These are given as the values
for <code>MASTER_USER</code> and <code>MASTER_PASSWORD</code> whenever a <code>CHANGE MASTER TO</code> command is
executed.</p>
<p>Both <code>replication_user</code> and <code>replication_password</code> parameters must be defined if
a custom replication user is used. If neither of the parameters is defined, the
<code>CHANGE MASTER TO</code>-command will use the monitor credentials for the replication
user.</p>
<p>The credentials used for replication must have the <code>REPLICATION SLAVE</code>
privilege.</p>
<p><code>replication_password</code> uses the same encryption scheme as other password
parameters. If password encryption is in use, <code>replication_password</code> must be
encrypted with the same key to avoid erroneous decryption.</p>
<h4 id="replication_master_ssl"><code>replication_master_ssl</code></h4>
<p>Type: bool Default: off</p>
<p>If set to ON, any <code>CHANGE MASTER TO</code>-command generated will set <code>MASTER_SSL=1</code> to enable
encryption for the replication stream. This setting should only be enabled if the backend
servers are configured for ssl. This typically means setting <em>ssl_ca</em>, <em>ssl_cert</em> and
<em>ssl_key</em> in the server configuration file. Additionally, credentials for the replication
user should require an encrypted connection (<code>e.g. ALTER USER repl@'%' REQUIRE SSL;</code>).</p>
<p>If the setting is left OFF, <code>MASTER_SSL</code> is not set at all, which will preserve existing
settings when redirecting a replica connection.</p>
<h4 id="replication_custom_options"><code>replication_custom_options</code></h4>
<p>Type: string</p>
<p>A custom string added to "CHANGE MASTER TO"-commands sent by the monitor
whenever setting up replication (e.g. during switchover). Useful for defining
ssl certificates or other specialized replication options. MaxScale does not
check the contents of the string, so care should be taken to ensure that
only valid options are set and that the contents do not interfere with
the options MaxScale sets on its own (e.g. MASTER_HOST). This setting can
also be configured for an individual server. If configured for both
the monitor and a server, the server setting takes priority.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>replication_custom_options=MASTER_SSL_CERT = '/tmp/certs/client-cert.pem',
                           MASTER_SSL_KEY = '/tmp/certs/client-key.pem',
                           MASTER_SSL_CA = '/tmp/certs/ca.pem',
                           MASTER_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=0
</pre></div>


<h4 id="failover_timeout-and-switchover_timeout"><code>failover_timeout</code> and <code>switchover_timeout</code></h4>
<p>Time limit for failover and switchover operations. The default
values are 90 seconds for both. <code>switchover_timeout</code> is also used as the time
limit for a rejoin operation. Rejoin should rarely time out, since it is a
faster operation than switchover.</p>
<p>The timeouts are specified as documented
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide/#durations">here</a>. If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeouts is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.</p>
<p>If no successful failover/switchover takes place within the configured time
period, a message is logged and automatic failover is disabled. This prevents
further automatic modifications to the misbehaving cluster.</p>
<h4 id="verify_master_failure-and-master_failure_timeout"><code>verify_master_failure</code> and <code>master_failure_timeout</code></h4>
<p>Enable additional primary failure verification for automatic failover.
<code>verify_master_failure</code> is a boolean value (default: true) which enables this
feature and <code>master_failure_timeout</code> defines the timeout (default: 10 seconds).</p>
<p>The primary failure timeout is specified as documented
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide/#durations">here</a>. If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.</p>
<p>Failure verification is performed by checking whether the replica servers are
still connected to the primary and receiving events. An event is either a change
in the <em>Gtid_IO_Pos</em>-field of the <code>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</code> output or a heartbeat
event. Effectively, if a replica has received an event within
<code>master_failure_timeout</code> duration, the primary is not considered down when
deciding whether to failover, even if MaxScale cannot connect to the primary.
<code>master_failure_timeout</code> should be longer than the <code>Slave_heartbeat_period</code> of
the replica connection to be effective.</p>
<p>If every replica loses its connection to the primary (<em>Slave_IO_Running</em> is not
"Yes"), primary failure is considered verified regardless of timeout. This allows
faster failover when the primary properly disconnects.</p>
<p>For automatic failover to activate, the <code>failcount</code> requirement must also be
met.</p>
<h4 id="servers_no_promotion"><code>servers_no_promotion</code></h4>
<p>This is a comma-separated list of server names that will not be chosen for
primary promotion during a failover or autoselected for switchover. This does not
affect switchover if the user selects the server to promote. Using this setting
can disrupt new primary selection for failover such that an non-optimal server is
chosen. At worst, this will cause replication to break. Alternatively, failover
may fail if all valid promotion candidates are in the exclusion list.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>servers_no_promotion=backup_dc_server1,backup_dc_server2
</pre></div>


<h4 id="promotion_sql_file-and-demotion_sql_file"><code>promotion_sql_file</code> and <code>demotion_sql_file</code></h4>
<p>These optional settings are paths to text files with SQL statements in them.
During promotion or demotion, the contents are read line-by-line and executed on
the backend. Use these settings to execute custom statements on the servers to
complement the built-in operations.</p>
<p>Empty lines or lines starting with '#' are ignored. Any results returned by the
statements are ignored. All statements must succeed for the failover, switchover
or rejoin to continue. The monitor user may require additional privileges and
grants for the custom commands to succeed.</p>
<p>When promoting a replica to primary during switchover or failover, the
<code>promotion_sql_file</code> is read and executed on the new primary server after its
read-only flag is disabled. The commands are ran <em>before</em> starting replication
from an external primary if any.</p>
<p><code>demotion_sql_file</code> is ran on an old primary during demotion to replica, before the
old primary starts replicating from the new primary. The file is also ran before
rejoining a standalone server to the cluster, as the standalone server is
typically a former primary server. When redirecting a replica replicating from a
wrong primary, the sql-file is not executed.</p>
<p>Since the queries in the files are ran during operations which modify
replication topology, care is required. If <code>promotion_sql_file</code> contains data
modification (DML) queries, the new primary server may not be able to
successfully replicate from an external primary. <code>demotion_sql_file</code> should never
contain DML queries, as these may not replicate to the replica servers before
replica threads are stopped, breaking replication.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>promotion_sql_file=/home/root/scripts/promotion.sql
demotion_sql_file=/home/root/scripts/demotion.sql
</pre></div>


<h4 id="handle_events"><code>handle_events</code></h4>
<p>This setting is on by default. If enabled, the monitor continuously queries the
servers for enabled scheduled events and uses this information when performing
cluster operations, enabling and disabling events as appropriate.</p>
<p>When a server is being demoted, any events with "ENABLED" status are set to
"SLAVESIDE_DISABLED". When a server is being promoted to primary, events that are either
"SLAVESIDE_DISABLED" or "DISABLED" are set to "ENABLED" if the same event was also enabled
on the old primary server last time it was successfully queried. Events are considered
identical if they have the same schema and name. When a standalone server is rejoined to
the cluster, its events are also disabled since it is now a replica.</p>
<p>The monitor does not check whether the same events were disabled and enabled during a
switchover or failover/rejoin. All events that meet the criteria above are altered.</p>
<p>The monitor does not enable or disable the event scheduler itself. For the
events to run on the new primary server, the scheduler should be enabled by the
admin. Enabling it in the server configuration file is recommended.</p>
<p>Events running at high frequency may cause replication to break in a failover
scenario. If an old primary which was failed over restarts, its event scheduler
will be on if set in the server configuration file. Its events will also
remember their "ENABLED"-status and run when scheduled. This may happen before
the monitor rejoins the server and disables the events. This should only be an
issue for events running more often than the monitor interval or events that run
immediately after the server has restarted.</p>
<h2 id="cooperative-monitoring">Cooperative monitoring</h2>
<p>As of MaxScale 2.5, MariaDB-Monitor supports cooperative monitoring. This means
that multiple monitors (typically in different MaxScale instances) can monitor
the same backend server cluster and only one will be the primary monitor. Only
the primary monitor may perform <em>switchover</em>, <em>failover</em> or <em>rejoin</em> operations.
The primary also decides which server is the primary. Cooperative monitoring is
enabled with the
<a href="#cooperative_monitoring_locks">cooperative_monitoring_locks</a>-setting.
Even with this setting, only one monitor per server per MaxScale is allowed.
This limitation can be circumvented by defining multiple copies of a server in
the configuration file.</p>
<p>Cooperative monitoring uses
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/get_lock/">server locks</a>
for coordinating between monitors. When cooperating, the monitor regularly
checks the status of a lock named <em>maxscale_mariadbmonitor</em> on every server and
acquires it if free. If the monitor acquires a majority of locks, it is the
primary. If a monitor cannot claim majority locks, it is a secondary monitor.</p>
<p>The primary monitor of a cluster also acquires the lock
<em>maxscale_mariadbmonitor_master</em> on the primary server. Secondary monitors check
which server this lock is taken on and only accept that server as the primary.
This arrangement is required so that multiple monitors can agree on which server
is the primary regardless of replication topology. If a secondary monitor does
not see the primary-lock taken, then it won't mark any server as [Master],
causing writes to fail.</p>
<p>The lock-setting defines how many locks are required for primary status. Setting
<code>cooperative_monitoring_locks=majority_of_all</code> means that the primary monitor
needs <em>n_servers/2 + 1</em> (rounded down) locks. For example, a cluster of three
servers needs two locks for majority, a cluster of four needs three, and a
cluster of five needs three.
This scheme is resistant against split-brain situations in the sense
that multiple monitors cannot be primary simultaneously. However, a split may
cause both monitors to consider themselves secondary, in which case a primary
server won't be detected.</p>
<p>Even without a network split, <code>cooperative_monitoring_locks=majority_of_all</code>
will lead to neither monitor claiming lock majority once too many servers go
down. This scenario is depicted in the image below. Only two out of four servers
are running when three are needed for majority. Although both MaxScales see both
running servers, neither is certain they have majority and the cluster stays in
read-only mode. If the primary server is down, no failover is performed either.</p>
<p><img src="images/coop_lock_no_majority.png"></p>
<p>Setting <code>cooperative_monitoring_locks=majority_of_running</code> changes the way
<em>n_servers</em> is calculated. Instead of using the total number of servers, only
servers currently [Running] are considered. This scheme adapts to multiple
servers going down, ensuring that claiming lock majority is always possible.
However, it can lead to multiple monitors claiming primary status in a
split-brain situation. As an example, consider a cluster with servers 1 to 4
with MaxScales A and B, as in the image below. MaxScale A can connect to
servers 1 and 2 (and claim their locks) but not to servers 3 and 4 due to
a network split. MaxScale A thus assumes servers 3 and 4 are down. MaxScale B
does the opposite, claiming servers 3 and 4 and assuming 1 and 2 are down.
Both MaxScales claim two locks out of two available and assume that they have
lock majority. Both MaxScales may then promote their own primaries and route
writes to different servers.</p>
<p><img src="images/coop_lock_split_brain.png"></p>
<p>The recommended strategy depends on which failure scenario is more likely and/or
more destructive. If it's unlikely that multiple servers are ever down
simultaneously, then <em>majority_of_all</em> is likely the safer choice. On the other
hand, if split-brain is unlikely but multiple servers may be down
simultaneously, then <em>majority_of_running</em> would keep the cluster operational.</p>
<p>To check if a monitor is primary, fetch monitor diagnostics with <code>maxctrl show
monitors</code> or the REST API. The boolean field <strong>primary</strong> indicates whether the
monitor has lock majority on the cluster. If cooperative monitoring is disabled,
the field value is <em>null</em>. Lock information for individual servers is listed in
the server-specific field <strong>lock_held</strong>. Again, <em>null</em> indicates that locks are
not in use or the lock status is unknown.</p>
<p>If a MaxScale instance tries to acquire the locks but fails to get majority
(perhaps another MaxScale was acquiring locks simultaneously) it will release
any acquired locks and try again after a random number of monitor ticks. This
prevents multiple MaxScales from fighting over the locks continuously as one
MaxScale will eventually wait less time than the others. Conflict probability
can be further decreased by configuring each monitor with a different
<em>monitor_interval</em>.</p>
<p>The flowchart below illustrates the lock handling logic.</p>
<p><img src="images/coop_lock_flowchart.svg"></p>
<h3 id="releasing-locks">Releasing locks</h3>
<p>Monitor cooperation depends on the server locks. The locks are
connection-specific. The owning connection can manually release a lock, allowing
another connection to claim it. Also, if the owning connection closes, the
MariaDB Server process releases the lock. How quickly a lost connection is
detected affects how quickly the primary monitor status moves from one monitor
and MaxScale to another.</p>
<p>If the primary MaxScale or its monitor is stopped normally, the monitor
connections are properly closed, releasing the locks. This allows the secondary
MaxScale to quickly claim the locks. However, if the primary simply vanishes
(broken network), the connection may just look idle. In this case, the
MariaDB Server may take a long time before it considers the monitor connection
lost. This time ultimately depends on TCP keepalive settings on the machines
running MariaDB Server.</p>
<p>On MariaDB Server 10.3.3 and later, the TCP keepalive settings can be configured
for just the server process. See
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#tcp_keepalive_interval">Server System Variables</a>
for information on settings <em>tcp_keepalive_interval</em>, <em>tcp_keepalive_probes</em> and
<em>tcp_keepalive_time</em>. These settings can also be set on the operating system
level, as described
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/usingkeepalive.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As of MaxScale  6.4.16, 22.08.13, 23.02.10, 23.08.6 and 24.02.2, configuring
TCP keepalive is no longer necessary as monitor sets the session <em>wait_timeout</em>
variable when acquiring a lock. This causes the MariaDB Server to close the
monitor connection if the connection appears idle for too long. The value of
<em>wait_timeout</em> used depends on the monitor interval and connection timeout
settings, and is logged at MaxScale startup.</p>
<p>A monitor can also be ordered to manually release its locks via the module
command <em>release-locks</em>. This is useful for manually changing the primary
monitor. After running the release-command, the monitor will not attempt to
reacquire the locks for one minute, even if it wasn't the primary monitor to
begin with. This command can cause the cluster to become temporarily unusable by
MaxScale. Only use it when there is another monitor ready to claim the locks.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl call command mariadbmon release-locks MyMonitor1
</pre></div>


<h2 id="backup-operations">Backup operations</h2>
<p>Backup operations manipulate the contents of a MariaDB Server, saving it or
overwriting it. MariaDB-Monitor supports three backup operations:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>rebuild-server</em>: Replace the contents of a database server with the
contents of another.</li>
<li><em>create-backup</em>: Copy the contents of a database server to a storage
location.</li>
<li><em>restore-from-backup</em>: Overwrite the contents of a database server with a
backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>These operations do not modify server config files, only files in the data
directory <em>/var/lib/mysql</em> are affected.</p>
<p>All of these operations are monitor commands and best launched with MaxCtrl.
The operations are asynchronous, which means MaxCtrl won't wait for the
operation to complete and instead immediately returns "OK". To see the current
status of an operation, either check MaxScale log or use the
fetch-cmd-result-command
(e.g. <code>maxctrl call command mariadbmon fetch-cmd-result MyMonitor</code>).</p>
<p>To perform backup operations, MaxScale requires ssh-access on all affected
machines. The <em>ssh_user</em> and <em>ssh_keyfile</em>-settings define the SSH credentials
MaxScale uses to access the servers. MaxScale must be able to run commands with
<em>sudo</em> on both the source and target servers. See <a href="#settings">settings</a> and
<a href="#sudoersd-configuration">sudoers.d configuration</a> below
for more information.</p>
<p>The following tools need to be installed on the backends:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Mariabackup</em>. Backs up and restores MariaDB Server contents. Installed e.g.
with <code>yum install MariaDB-backup</code>. See
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariabackup/">Mariabackup documentation</a> for more
information.</li>
<li><em>pigz</em>. Compresses and decompresses the backup stream. Installed e.g. with
<code>yum install pigz</code>.</li>
<li><em>socat</em>. Streams data from one machine to another. Is likely already
installed. If not, can be installed e.g. with <code>yum install socat</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mariabackup needs server credentials to log in and authenticate to the
MariaDB Server being copied from. For this, MaxScale uses the monitor user.
The monitor user may thus require additional privileges. See
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariabackup-overview/#authentication-and-privileges">Mariabackup documentation</a>
for more details.</p>
<h3 id="rebuild-server">Rebuild server</h3>
<p>The rebuild server-operation replaces the contents of a database server with the
contents of another server. The source server is effectively cloned and all data
on the target server is lost. This is useful when a replica server has diverged
from the primary server, or when adding a new server to the cluster.
MaxScale performs this operation by running Mariabackup on both the
source and target servers.</p>
<p>When launched, the rebuild operation proceeds as below. If any step fails, the
operation is stopped and the target server will be left in an unspecified state.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to both servers with ssh and check that the tools listed above are
present (e.g. <code>mariabackup -v</code> should succeed).</li>
<li>Check that the port used for transferring the backup is free on the source
server. If not, kill the process holding it. This requires running <em>lsof</em> and
<em>kill</em>.</li>
<li>Test the connection by streaming a short message from the source host to the
target.</li>
<li>Launch Mariabackup on the source machine, compress the stream and listen
for an incoming connection. This is performed with a command like
<code>mariabackup --backup --safe-slave-backup --stream=xbstream | pigz -c | socat - TCP-LISTEN:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Stop MariaDB-server on the target machine and delete all contents of the data
directory <em>/var/lib/mysql</em>.</li>
<li>On the target machine, connect to the source machine, read the backup stream,
decompress it and write to the data directory. This is performed with a command
like <code>socat -u TCP:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; STDOUT | pigz -dc | mbstream -x</code>. This step can
take a long time if there is much data to transfer.</li>
<li>Check that the data directory on the target machine is not empty,
i.e. that the transfer at least appears to have succeeded.</li>
<li>Prepare the backup on the target server with a command like
<code>mariabackup --use-memory=1G --prepare</code>. This step can also take some time if
the source server performed writes during data transfer.</li>
<li>On the target server, change ownership of datadir contents to the
<em>mysql</em>-user and start MariaDB-server.</li>
<li>Read gtid from the data directory. Have the target server start replicating
from the primary if it is not one already.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rebuild-operation is a monitor module command and takes three arguments:
the monitor name, target server name and source server name.
The source server can be left out, in which case it is autoselected.
When autoselecting, the monitor prefers to pick an up-to-date replica server to
avoid increasing load on a primary server.
Due to the <code>--safe-slave-backup</code>-option, the replica will stop
replicating until the backup data has been transferred.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl call command mariadbmon async-rebuild-server MyMonitor MyTargetServer MySourceServer
</pre></div>


<p>The operation does not launch if the target server is already replicating or if
the source server is not a primary or replica.</p>
<p>Steps 6 and 8 can take a long time depending on the size of the database and if
writes are ongoing. During these steps, the monitor will continue monitoring the
cluster normally. After each monitor tick the monitor checks if the
rebuild-operation can proceed. No other monitor operations, either manual or
automatic, can run until the rebuild completes.</p>
<h3 id="create-backup">Create backup</h3>
<p>The create backup-operation copies the contents of a database server to the
backup storage. The source server is not modified but may slow down during
backup creation. MaxScale performs this operation by running
Mariabackup on both the source and storage servers. The storage location is
defined by the <em>backup_storage_address</em> and <em>backup_storage_path</em> settings.
Normal ssh-settings are used to access the storage server. The backup storage
machine does not need to have a MariaDB Server installed.</p>
<p>Backup creation runs somewhat similar to rebuild-server. The main difference
is that the backup data is simply saved to a directory and not prepared or
used to start a MariaDB Server. If any step fails, the operation is stopped
and the backup storage directory will be left in an unspecified state.</p>
<ol>
<li>Init. See rebuild-server.</li>
<li>Check listen port on backup storage machine. See rebuild-server.</li>
<li>Check that the backup storage main directory exists. Check that it does not
contain a backup with the same name as the one being created. Create the final
backup directory.</li>
<li>Test the connection by streaming a short message from the source host to the
backup storage.</li>
<li>Serve backup on source. Similar to rebuild-server step 4.</li>
<li>Transfer backup directly to the final storage directory. Similar to
rebuild-server step 5.</li>
<li>Check that the copied backup data looks ok.</li>
</ol>
<p>Backup creation is a monitor module command and takes three
arguments: the monitor name, source server name and backup name. Backup name
defines the subdirectory where the backup is saved and should be a valid
directory name. The command</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl call command mariadbmon async-create-backup MyMonitor MySourceServer wednesday_161122
</pre></div>


<p>would save the backup of MySourceServer to
<code>&lt;backup_storage_path&gt;/wednesday_161122</code> on the host defined in
<em>backup_storage_address</em>. <em>ssh_user</em> needs to have read and write access
to the main storage directory. The source server must be a primary or replica.</p>
<p>Similar to rebuild-server, the monitor will continue monitoring the servers
while the backup is transferred.</p>
<h3 id="restore-from-backup">Restore from backup</h3>
<p>The restore-operation is the reverse of create-backup. It overwrites the
contents of an existing MariaDB Server with a backup from the backup storage.
The backup is not removed and can be used again. MaxScale performs this
operation by transferring the backup contents as a tar archive and overwriting
the target server data directory. The backup storage is defined in monitor
settings similar to create-backup.</p>
<p>The restore-operation runs somewhat similar to rebuild-server. The main
difference is that the backup data is copied with <em>tar</em> instead of Mariabackup.
If any step fails, the operation is stopped and the target server will be
left in an unspecified state.</p>
<ol>
<li>Init. See rebuild-server.</li>
<li>Check listen port on target machine. See rebuild-server.</li>
<li>Check that the backup storage main directory exists and that it contains
a backup with the name requested.</li>
<li>Test the connection by streaming a short message from the backup storage to
the target machine.</li>
<li>On the backup storage machine, compress the backup with tar and serve it
with socat, listening for an incoming connection. This is performed with
a command like <code>tar -zc -C &lt;backup_dir&gt; . | socat - TCP-LISTEN:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Stop MariaDB-server on the target machine and delete all contents of the data
directory <em>/var/lib/mysql</em>.</li>
<li>On the target machine, connect to the source machine, read the backup stream,
decompress it and write to the data directory. This is performed with a command
like  <code>socat -u TCP:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; STDOUT | sudo tar -xz -C /var/lib/mysql/</code>.
This step can take a long time if there is much data to transfer.</li>
<li>From here on, the operation proceeds as from rebuild-server step 7.</li>
</ol>
<p>Server restoration is a monitor module command and takes three
arguments: the monitor name, target server name and backup name. Backup name
defines the subdirectory where the backup is read from and should be an
existing directory on the backup storage host. The command</p>
<div><pre><span></span>maxctrl call command mariadbmon async-restore-from-backup MyMonitor MyTargetServer wednesday_161122
</pre></div>


<p>would erase the contents of MyTargetServer and replace them with the backup
contained in
<code>&lt;backup_storage_path&gt;/wednesday_161122</code> on the host defined in
<em>backup_storage_address</em>. <em>ssh_user</em> needs to have read access
to the main storage directory and the backup. The target server must not be
a primary or replica.</p>
<p>Similar to rebuild-server, the monitor will continue monitoring the servers
while the backup is transferred and prepared.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<h4 id="ssh_user"><code>ssh_user</code></h4>
<p>String. Ssh username. Used when logging in to backend servers to run commands.</p>
<h4 id="ssh_keyfile"><code>ssh_keyfile</code></h4>
<p>Path to file with an ssh private key. Used when logging in to backend servers to
run commands.</p>
<h4 id="ssh_check_host_key"><code>ssh_check_host_key</code></h4>
<p>Boolean, default: true. When logging in to backends, require that the server is
already listed in the known_hosts-file of the user running MaxScale.</p>
<h4 id="ssh_timeout"><code>ssh_timeout</code></h4>
<p>Time, default: 10s. The rebuild operation consists of multiple ssh
commands. Most of the commands are assumed to complete quickly. If these
commands take more than <em>ssh_timeout</em> to complete, the operation fails. Adjust
this setting if rebuild fails due to ssh commands timing out. This setting does
not affect steps 5 and 6, as these are assumed to take significant time.</p>
<h4 id="ssh_port"><code>ssh_port</code></h4>
<p>Numeric, default: 22. SSH port. Used for running remote commands on servers.</p>
<h4 id="rebuild_port"><code>rebuild_port</code></h4>
<p>Numeric, default: 4444. The port which the source server listens on for a
connection. The port must not be blocked by a firewall or listened on by any
other program. If another process is listening on the port when rebuild is
starting, MaxScale will attempt to kill the process.</p>
<h4 id="backup_storage_address"><code>backup_storage_address</code></h4>
<p>String. Address of the backup storage. Does not need to have MariaDB Server
running or be monitored by the monitor. Connected to with ssh. Must have enough
disk space to store all backups.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>backup_storage_address=192.168.1.11
</pre></div>


<h4 id="backup_storage_path"><code>backup_storage_path</code></h4>

<h3 id="sudoersd-configuration">sudoers.d configuration</h3>
<p>If giving MaxScale general sudo-access is out of the question, MaxScale must be
allowed to run the specific commands required by the backup operations. This can
be achieved by creating a file with the commands in the
<code>/etc/sudoers.d</code>-directory. In the example below, the user <em>johnny</em> is given the
power to run commands as root. The contents of the file may need to be tweaked
due to changes in install locations.</p>

</pre></div>


<h2 id="columnstore-commands">ColumnStore commands</h2>
<p>Since MaxScale version 22.08, MariaDB Monitor can run ColumnStore administrative
commands against a ColumnStore cluster. The commands interact with the
ColumnStore REST-API present in recent ColumnStore versions and have been tested
with MariaDB-Server 10.6 running the ColumnStore plugin version 6.2. None of the
commands affect monitor configuration or replication topology. MariaDB Monitor
simply relays the commands to the backend cluster.</p>
<p>MariaDB Monitor can fetch cluster status, add and remove nodes, start and stop
the cluster, and set cluster read-only or readwrite. MaxScale only communicates
with the first server in the <code>servers</code>-list.</p>
<p>Most of the commands are asynchronous, i.e. they do not wait for the operation
to complete on the ColumnStore backend before returning to the command prompt.
MariaDB Monitor itself, however, runs the command in the background and does not
perform normal monitoring until the operation completes or fails. After an
operation has started the user should use <em>fetch-cmd-result</em> to check its
status. The examples below show how to run the commands using MaxCtrl. If a
command takes a timeout-parameter, the timeout can be given in seconds (s),
minutes (m) or hours (h).</p>
<p>ColumnStore command settings are listed <a href="#settings">here</a>. At least
<code>cs_admin_api_key</code> must be set.</p>
<h3 id="get-status">Get status</h3>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="failoverswitchover-fails">Failover/switchover fails</h3>
<p>See the <a href="#limitations_and_requirements">Limitations and requirements-section</a>.</p>
<p>Before performing failover or switchover, the monitor checks that
prerequisites are fulfilled, printing any errors and warnings found. This should
catch and explain most issues with failover or switchover not working.
If the operations are attempted and still fail, then most likely one of
the commands the monitor issued to a server failed or timed out. The log should
explain which query failed.</p>
<p>A typical failure reason is that a command such as <code>STOP SLAVE</code> takes longer than the
<code>backend_read_timeout</code> of the monitor, causing the connection to break. As of 2.3, the
monitor will retry most such queries if the failure was caused by a timeout. The retrying
continues until the total time for a failover or switchover has been spent. If the log
shows warnings or errors about commands timing out, increasing the backend timeout
settings of the monitor should help. Other settings to look at are <code>query_retries</code> and
<code>query_retry_timeout</code>. These are general MaxScale settings described in the
<a href="/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2308-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide/">Configuration guide</a>. Setting
<code>query_retries</code> to 2 is a reasonable first try.</p>
<p>If switchover causes the old primary (now replica) to fail replication, then most
likely a user or perhaps a scheduled event performed a write while monitor
had set <code>read_only=1</code>. This is possible if the user performing the write has
"SUPER" or "READ_ONLY ADMIN" privileges. The switchover-operation tries to kick
out SUPER-users but this is not certain to succeed. Remove these privileges
from any users that regularly do writes to prevent them from interfering with
switchover.</p>
<p>The server configuration files should have <code>log-slave-updates=1</code> to ensure that
a newly promoted primary has binary logs of previous events. This allows the new
primary to replicate past events to any lagging replicas.</p>
<p>To print out all queries sent to the servers, start MaxScale with
<code>--debug=enable-statement-logging</code>. This setting prints all queries sent to the
backends by monitors and authenticators. The printed queries may include
usernames and passwords.</p>
<h3 id="replica-detection-shows-external-primaries">Replica detection shows external primaries</h3>
<p>If a replica is shown in <em>maxctrl</em> as "Slave of External Server" instead of
"Slave", the reason is likely that the "Master_Host"-setting of the replication connection
does not match the MaxScale server definition. As of 2.3.2, the MariaDB Monitor by default
assumes that the replica connections (as shown by <code>SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS</code>) use the exact
same "Master_Host" as used the MaxScale configuration file server definitions. This is
controlled by the setting <a href="#assume_unique_hostnames">assume_unique_hostnames</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-mariadb-monitor-with-binlogrouter">Using the MariaDB Monitor With Binlogrouter</h2>
<p>Since MaxScale 2.2 it's possible to detect a replication setup
which includes Binlog Server: the required action is to add the
binlog server to the list of servers only if <em>master_id</em> identity is set.</p>
