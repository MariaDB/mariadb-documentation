&lt;p&gt;I was sure it was the "#" character in the password.  I just could not find a list of "unapproved" characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will check my shell.  I wonder if the # is for some comment indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you for your assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure why you are experiencing problems, perhaps a shell setting. You can test for yourself if the '#' character is causing a problem in your environment by removing it, but there is no reason I know of from MariaDB's side for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I cannot cut-and-paste, so I am typing this in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo mysql -u root -p
[sudo] password for ubuntu:  {I type in the sudo password}
Enter password:  {I type in the mariadb root password}
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor......
...Server version: 10.0.25-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 Ubuntu 16.04
...
MariaDB [(none)]&amp;gt; SET PASSWORD FOR 'nextclouduser'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('35KMMeiibw#=');&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that line generates the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is as if you cannot use the "#" symbol in your password.
    :... right syntax to use near '"35KMMeiibw"'  ..." it truncates at the # symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read and respond.&lt;/p&gt;
