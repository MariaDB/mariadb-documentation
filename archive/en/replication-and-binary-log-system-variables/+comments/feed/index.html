&lt;p&gt;That's because this type of variables belongs to the @@global/@@session class.
And its semantics was settled long time ago so the session first initializes its private instance from the current value of the overall system-wide @@global "parent".
And *then* it is free to change its @@session.
So if one would prefer a behavior like you did then the freedom of making changes
obviously suffers a lot. In such use case the variable would had to be defined
as a pure @@global.
However, I don't see as impossible to merge two perceptions with introduction of a 
magic value to the global instance of the @@global/@@session that would turn it into the pure @@global class.&lt;/p&gt;

Old existing connections still work with the old values for aii and aio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not really what I expected...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Description: Slave threads will be restricted to replicating the specified tables, provided in comma-delimited format. ... The directive does not accept a comma-delimited list..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's fairly contradictory...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_image"&gt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_image&lt;/a&gt; quoted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The default value is full. In MySQL 5.5 and earlier, full row images are always used for both before images and after images."&lt;/p&gt;

On previous versions, was the default behavior to always include all columns?&lt;/p&gt;

e.g. replicate_wild_ignore_table = "db1.table2%"
or, replicate_wild_ignore_table = "%.table2%"&lt;/p&gt;

It is documented on the list of &lt;a href="/kb/en/mysqld-options-full-list/#replication-options"&gt;mysqld options&lt;/a&gt;. But I agree, it's natural to be mentioned here as well and should be added.&lt;/p&gt;
