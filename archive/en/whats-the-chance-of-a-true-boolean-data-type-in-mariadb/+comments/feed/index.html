&lt;p&gt;MySQL at one point stated in their documentation that they planned to implement this in a future release, in which case MariaDB would probably pull it in, but I can't find this statement on the MySQL docs any more. It may have been removed, and perhaps there are no longer plans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

A Boolean type can be viewed as an enumerated type with the two values TRUE and FALSE, besides of course being the fundamental element in logical expressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of language design is to protect us—and anybody who might try to reuse our code—from making dumb mistakes. If you use, say, a TINYINT for a Boolean, sure as shootin' somebody will come along and assign integer values to it. Then what? When the problem is so easily avoidable with a proper Boolean type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider Java: it gets a lot of criticism for demanding too much "ceremony", but in my experience this helps to prevent errors, or at least to make them obvious when they do arise. &lt;/p&gt;
