I tried changing the permissions and tunning mysql with different users ( including root and it never worked ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What i ended up doing was to reset my box to Ubuntu1604 and now it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to point out though that it even now it does not work from &lt;strong&gt;anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;. What i mean by that for instance, im getting null if i read from my own home folder but it did not have any problems while reading from a &lt;strong&gt;/data&lt;/strong&gt;  that did not even belonged to my user but to root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing that makes this so difficult is that there is noway to get that internal failure logged which makes troibleahooting very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

I tested in Xubuntu 16.04 and it worked perfectly fine. I did not even granted FILE privilege there for my account. The problem seems to be in 1804 for now.&lt;/p&gt;

It does not come with Ubuntu by default and I have not installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
