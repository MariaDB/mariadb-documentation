&lt;p&gt;Are you talking about MariaDB being offered as an official part of a turn-key hosting plan? Or are you talking about MariaDB being supported by common hosting dashboard software like cpanel? Or are you talking about getting a 24/7 support contract? Or are you talking about something completely different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting companies are, naturally, free to incorporate MariaDB into their offerings, and some have already done so. I guess I just don't understand your question, please clarify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
