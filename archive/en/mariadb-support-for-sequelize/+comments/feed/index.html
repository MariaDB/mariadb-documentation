&lt;p&gt;sequelize seems to have a rather vibrant community of MariaDB contributors already based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pulls?q=mariadb"&gt;github pull requests for sequelize&lt;/a&gt;. MariaDB people we certainly contribute fixes or issues on projects as we notice and time permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do notice that occasionally frameworks miss out on new features because they don't get noticed. I hope to expand this activity to try to audit the database adapters in many languages and determine which MariaDB features they don't support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FeatherJS appears to &lt;a href="https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/services.html#database-adapters"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; Knex, Sequalize or Objection (built on Knex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched a bit more on &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks"&gt;Stack Overflow Survery 2021&lt;/a&gt; for other NodeJS DB frameworks but there wasn't a significant answer. Perhaps we need to run a survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the NodeJS community is much more qualified to assess how well various ORMs perform and are easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
