&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your reply. So by default it's FederatedX from version 5.1 - even though it's still called Federated in the plugins list? I guess I was expecting the name to be different in SHOW PLUGINS to reflect the new version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume it's a standard MariaDB install. I inherited it from my predecessor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;show plugins;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, where does your version of MariaDB come from? Can only suggest getting hold of a version with it present. I'm sure you're aware 5.5 is also long EOL, but is still available &lt;a href="https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/+releases/"&gt;from the archives&lt;/a&gt; if you specifically need that version.&lt;/p&gt;
