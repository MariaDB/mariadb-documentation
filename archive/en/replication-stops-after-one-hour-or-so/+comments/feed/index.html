You were right about the tables. We have one without a primary key and about 390000 records (created a long time before i joined the company).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore the DELETE statement is encapsulated in a transaction, so the Execution-Pointer really stops for an extensive time. I was able to find the problem by looking into the binlogs with "mysqlbinlog". Very useful tool. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction!&lt;/p&gt;

Exec_Master_Log_Pos is static (which is bad), but Relay_Log_Space is increasing, as well as Read_Master_Log_Pos, so IO seems to work. Seconds_Behind_Master (SBM) is ticking up one second per second (bad). Slave_IO_State is "Waiting for master to send event".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial state, right after setting up replication and starting the slave, he goes down from like 1700 SBM to zero SBM and the servers are in full sync. And then, after "some amount of time" the slave simply stops executing the changes made to the master. We have large tables (27 million records) but they are well indexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With "show full processlist" i see that he is executing "Reading event from the relay log" for the same time as SBM. I also see that the slave is running at 100% (or even more, multicore) CPU. I just checked the binlog AFTER the last executed entry and saw a lot of "at &amp;lt;some number&amp;gt;" with nothing behind (so i guess its a read-query on the master) but then a large block of deletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will setup replication again, wait for it to fail and check that sequence again. Maybe this is the right track...&lt;/p&gt;

replication. Both in case of error and normal STOP SLAVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you actually mean with "replication stops"? What does SHOW SLAVE
STATUS say? Are the SQL thread and IO thread running?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is running but just slow, you need to investigate what it is
that is slow. You mention row-based replication, one thing that can _really_
be slow in row-based replication is updates/deletes to large tables with no
primary key, that should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
