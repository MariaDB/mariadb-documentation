Please correct me if I have taken some incorrect steps here in the migration for testing purposes. I have installed &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-5534-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5.34&lt;/a&gt;-1 . I then did a complete dump of my DB from MySQL and then created two new databases on MariaDB test server so that I could do some A/B testing. I imported the dump file into both databases. All tables were using the MyISAM storage engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then converted all tables in DB-A to Aria and left all tables in DB-B as MyISAM, after which I optimized all tables in both DB's. I have run various simple select statements on each DB and it appears that Aria is slower and in some cases considerably slower compared to MyISAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such result below:
MyISAM results 56044 rows in set (4.05 sec)
Aria results 56044 rows in set (6.77 sec)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is this performance hit a result of Aria being crash proof? Is there something else I should be doing to the tables other than what I have done with the import, converting to Aria and then optimizing them to squeeze out better performance?&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies for not making that clear. I was also looking to find out which storage engine would be the closest to feature set, etc. to MyISAM?
Many thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

But it is always good to have a dump ready as well, and of course don't forget to make a backup before upgrading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you upgrade to 5.5, it might happen that the server won't start if you have some options in your config file that were deprecated earlier and removed in 5.5 (it could happen regardless whether you upgrade from/to MySQL or from/to MariaDB, only versions count here). One usual problem is &lt;code&gt;default-character-set&lt;/code&gt; in the server config, although there might be more. In this case just read carefully what the error log says and act accordingly, or ask if you can't interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding storage engines choice, for the best experience I would recommend to do it one step at a time. Upgrade, see if it runs all right for you and you don't have any problems. Then, you can check &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/aria-faq/#how-does-aria-15-compare-to-myisam"&gt;Aria vs MyISAM&lt;/a&gt; KB page and see if there are any differences that you find potentially useful for your data and workflow. Check all sections regarding advantages, disadvantages, differences to fix and differences not to be fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially you could also consider migrating to InnoDB, but this is definitely not something you should make a decision about lightly, it requires analysis and often the internal knowledge of applications you are using. Even more so for migrating to TokuDB. &lt;/p&gt;

what storage engine would you recommend we try, Ari or? Some of these tables contain in excess of a million rows. Is there anything I should be aware of before converting tables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, only table size isn't a metric to select a engine... it's read only? 10% read 90% write? 10% write 90% read? you need table or row lock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have some myisam tables that i converted to aria just to allow a crash safe feature, it works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i don't have centos to answer your first questions, maybe the binary is easier... just untar and change your my.cnf to point to new share,data,binary files and directories&lt;/p&gt;
