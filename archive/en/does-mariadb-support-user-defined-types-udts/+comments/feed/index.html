There is a request to support it, &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10143"&gt;MDEV-10143&lt;/a&gt;, but no timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content from the SQL-99 book clearly says that it's about the standard, not necessarily supported in MariaDB. It's listed on the KB as the book contents have been made available and may be of interest to people.&lt;/p&gt;

It does say that this is part of the book but its confusing to any reader. Is it part of MariaDB or not is the question. There is an unanswered query on the same issue on StackOverflow also which quotes exactly this KB page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another related query, if this is just some book which talks of standards then why keep it as part of KB here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, is there any plan to support UDTs in MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

Which KB page/sample code does not work?&lt;/p&gt;
