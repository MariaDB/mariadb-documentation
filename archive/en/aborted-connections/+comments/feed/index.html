&lt;p&gt;probably this is the solution. I can see many TCP connection on port 8080 with status "waiting..." and one of our processes (java/ActiveMQ) has over 80000 handles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will monitor this...&lt;/p&gt;

But something else must have happened regarding the server environment. A few years the system worked fine. And suddenly problems with the connections and this only after a few weeks of trouble-free runtime ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Peter&lt;/p&gt;

If this fails this way, you're not opening a pooled connection obviously. I'd generally prefer and recommend the community .NET driver to the one of Oracle , exactly because I've seen Oracle's one from inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our applikations use MYSql Connector/NET and DbConnection.Open() to create a connection to the database and suddently this method fails and cause the error in the error log. (By the way: By default we use connection pooling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the reason why the method DbConnection.Open() fails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;telnet localhost 3306&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will suffice after some time, your telnet connection will be closed, you'll see such message in the error log.&lt;/p&gt;
