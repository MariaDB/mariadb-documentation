Do test in a test environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://issues.joomla.org/"&gt;https://issues.joomla.org/&lt;/a&gt; shows an attention to fixing MariaDB related incompatibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

If I correct my database so that it becomes MariaDB syntax, do you know if Joomla4 will accept/recognize my new MariaDB database file (i.e. how good is the compatibility between Joomla4 and a MariaDB database)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also install joomla directly on my online server and then re-create there my website (I would have to recreate the structure with the menus, articles and modules, but could copy/paste all the texts and custom css). Maybe this would be easier (for me, as I'm not a programmer :-) ) than learning to re-write MySQL in MariaDB language.&lt;/p&gt;

Most are probably syntax errors. Then look for a relevant knowledge base page along the the difference documentation Ian linked to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sqlines has &lt;a href="https://sqlines.com/mysql-to-mariadb"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on MySQL to MariaDB migration, not as comprehensive as the above referenced links, however it does have some automation.&lt;/p&gt;

I read the page "Upgrading from MySQL to MariaDB". For someone having little knowledge regarding databases, it is however very difficult to understand, so I don't really know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="/kb/en/upgrading-from-mysql-to-mariadb/"&gt;Upgrading from MySQL to MariaDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/kb/en/incompatibilities-and-feature-differences-between-mariadb-104-and-mysql-80/"&gt;Incompatibilities and Feature Differences Between MariaDB 10.4 and MySQL 8.0&lt;/a&gt;. The solution depends on what the incompatibilities are.&lt;/p&gt;
