&lt;p&gt;If you are currently replicating between MySQL 5.6 servers, after replacing the slave with &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5&lt;/a&gt; server you might encounter the same problems as you would have by using MySQL 5.5 as a slave, since replicating from a newer master to an older slave has its limitations. &lt;/p&gt;

Or do both Master and Slave have to be Maria in order for replication to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we currently are not enforcing foreign key constraints between tables , these relationships are being handled on the application level. We are replicating Innodb (Master) to MyISAM (slaves). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would i be able to do the same with Maria in place on the slave side? &lt;/p&gt;
