In the event, plans changed and I gave up trying to do the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem lies in the JDBC driver for MariaDB and the Hibernate Tools. If you crank up Hibernate's logging you'll see messages like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2014-12-03 21:16:00,214 [main] DEBUG reveng.JDBCReader  - Ignoring table locations of type BASE TABLE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the MariaDB JDBC driver was reporting the types of the table as BASE TABLE, however Hibernate Tools will only generate reverse engineered files for database objects of type TABLE or VIEW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Hibernate Tools 4.3.1.CR1: org.hibernate.cfg.reveng.JDBCReader#processTables():&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if ( ("TABLE".equalsIgnoreCase(tableType) || "VIEW".equalsIgnoreCase(tableType) /*|| "SYNONYM".equals(tableType) */) ) { //||
...
} else {
  log.debug("Ignoring table " + tableName + " of type " + tableType);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work around it I just used the legacy MySQL JDBC driver to do the reverse engineering and then switched to the MariaDB driver for actual usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave up trying to make the reverse engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was already an ORM in place (Toplink). So, I used some of the files generated by Toplink which capture the mapping in XML. I used this to generate the Java code for Hibernate with JPA. It works nicely. I don't have a big risk of needing to change the database - it's a legacy app that's very stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you could do is to turn on the general log in MariaDB by starting mysqld with --general-log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this you will at least know what kind of queries the wizard is sending to MariaDB. Maybe that may help you to how to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;
