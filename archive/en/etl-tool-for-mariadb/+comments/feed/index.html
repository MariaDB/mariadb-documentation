&lt;p&gt;I can recommend Skyvia (&lt;a href="https://skyvia.com/connectors/mariadb"&gt;https://skyvia.com/connectors/mariadb&lt;/a&gt;) because this ETL tool is easy to use, not expensive, and covers many data integration scenarious. Moreover, it supports 200+ connectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope it will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

You could look at Talend and Pentaho for their free open source offerings or you can look to just about any ETL too that is commercially available. From experience the Talend tool has a bit of a steep climb up initially to get into a productive state, however it is amazingly powerful and in a diverse environment or in one that is growing with a variety of products and needs, it might be worth the effort to develop that skill.
There is a bunch of other opensource ETL tools such as CloverETL, however for our own reasons I am looking further presently at Talend&lt;/p&gt;
