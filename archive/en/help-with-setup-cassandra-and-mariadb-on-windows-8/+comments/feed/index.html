Currently there is no Cassandra SE in Windows binaries, nor is there an open task to make it happen. If it's desirable, please feel free to file a request at &lt;a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa"&gt;MariaDB JIRA&lt;/a&gt;. Better still if you are able to contribute a patch with the necessary changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:
1)Is Cassandra part of the Windows MSI installer by default or does one need to install a seperate Cassandra DB instance
2) How do you link Thrift with the Windows Client&lt;/p&gt;
