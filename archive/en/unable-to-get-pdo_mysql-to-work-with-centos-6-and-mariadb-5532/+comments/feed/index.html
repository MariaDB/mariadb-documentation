'Something' installed it's own version of pdo_mysql.so instead of either yours or one compiled against mysql. Did a yum install yum install php-mysql-5.4.19 from the remi repo and it fixed the problem instantly. Thanks for the heads up.&lt;/p&gt;

Against MySQL client library from Oracle? That would explain the error you're seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we added symbol versioning to our client library we carefully tried to keep it drop-in replacement and picked exactly the same versioning that CentOS mysql-libs package uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this versioning logic, mysql_options has version libmysqlclient_16, because, indeed, it was present in the old libmysqlclient.so.16 and it haven't changed since. Thus it retained the old version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL client library from Oracle, on the other hand, has all symbols under the new libmysqlclient_18 version, even symbols that have not changed when the version was incremented. This makes Oracle libmysqlclient.so.18 incompatible with CentOS mysql-libs and with our client library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend you to recompile pdo_mysql.so using either CentOS or our libmysqlclient.so&lt;/p&gt;
