I had replications fails to restart after switchover many times. Then, I started using Orchestrator and never had an issue again.
Turns out, Orchestrator [1] only set `SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;` on the primary before switchover.
Then I read this answer &lt;a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/74670/revoke-write-privileges-vs-setting-database-to-readonly"&gt;https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/74670/revoke-write-privileges-vs-setting-database-to-readonly&lt;/a&gt; which explain the advantages of read_only over FTWRL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other thing, in last chapter, "Now you can upgrade the new master to a newer version" should be "Now you can upgrade the &lt;strong&gt;OLD&lt;/strong&gt; master to a newer version"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your great documentation, Laurent Indermühle&lt;/p&gt;
