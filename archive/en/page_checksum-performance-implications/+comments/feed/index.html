it's a extra safety? i think not, it's a faster repair feature (in my opnion)
but must check what this change in source code of aria handler&lt;/p&gt;

What's the benefits of enabling page checksums? I couldn't find something more concrete than "it enables extra safety". I mean, what could go wrong that page checksums could save me when compared to not having it enabled?&lt;/p&gt;
