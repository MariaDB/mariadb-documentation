&lt;p&gt;May I know , why mariadb believes the backup is from a crashed db?&lt;/p&gt;

The crash recovery on a post MariaDB-10.2.2 doesn't follow the early versions data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is start a MariaDB-10.1 version up, get it to cleanly shutdown, and then upgrade to 10.3. I recommend going further than 10.3 as this reaches end of maintenance early next year. 10.6 is the current long term announced version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As having two MariaDB version installed on an OS can be hard, I recommend a &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/"&gt;mariadb:10.1&lt;/a&gt; container with your datadir passed in as a volume to /var/lib/mysql.&lt;/p&gt;
