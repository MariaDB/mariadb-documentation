It is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mariadb-upgrade  Ver 2.0 Distrib 10.6.7-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have another image for slackware that I have not upgraded to ver 10.6.7.  It shows these versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mariadb-upgrade  Ver 1.4 Distrib 10.5.13-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the strange thing is that I just rebooted the system with ver 10.6.7, ran mariadb-upgrade, and it completed successfully.  In addition I was able to start the mythbackend for mythtv and it appears to be working fine with the mariadb ver 10.6.7.  Was there a workaround for the fact that "Offset" is or was a reserved word in version 10.6.x?  Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the output after upgrade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;mysql --version

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mariadb-upgrade -p

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main concern is that I would not be able to run mythtv if the mariadb upgrade was not successful. Mythtv does start now and I can play recorded shows, but I cannot set up new recordings -- I get a message that "could not start recording". The last time I tried to make this upgrade from 10.5.x to 10.6.x it became apparent that "Offset" is a reserved word now for &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-106/"&gt;MariaDB 10.6&lt;/a&gt;.x and I believe this word is used to set up the duration of the recordings. Will I be able to make this upgrade if mariadb-upgrade does not work and/or will mythtv have to make adjustments for using the word "Offset" in their queries?&lt;/p&gt;

If you have a lightly different client and server package this might be the error. Also if you force the server version you may see differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mysql_upgrade and mariadb-upgrade are the same program, we are just in the process of removing mysql names slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact error message and the mariadb-upgrade and mariadbd (server) versions would help.&lt;/p&gt;
