&lt;p&gt;Windows 10, 10.1.37-MariaDB, full permissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, this would *only* happen if I disconnected from WiFi. Connect again and problem solved. But after setting up a VPN last night, I was not able to connect at all. I dropped and re-created the user and this seemed to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not clear to my how/why this would do anything or if this could happen again in production. (I'm currently in development). I would like to know how it happened and how to prevent it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

How are you connecting? Are you sure you are connecting with the same user when connected?&lt;/p&gt;
