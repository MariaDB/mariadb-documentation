That was the issue.  Rather than stop/start mariadb I rebooted my server and afterwards I was able to run mysql_upgrade successfully.  Since Slackware does not use sysctl to start/stop processes I checked in my /etc/rc.d/ directory for the rc.mysqld script and I see an rc.mysqld from Mar 27 2019 and an rc.mysqld.new from yesterday's date (in other words current).  Would there be an advantage in moving the .new script to the active one?&lt;/p&gt;

The mariadb-upgrade client version is 10.6.8. It may just be the 10.5.13 version wasn't shutdown during the upgrade.  A normal kill of the process should result in a clean shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
