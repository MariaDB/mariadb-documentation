&lt;p&gt;Some open source replacements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://beekeeperstudio.io"&gt;Beekeeper Studio&lt;/a&gt; (also supports other databases)

&lt;p&gt;First off, if you run a web server, you can use phpMyAdmin, which is nice because it will work on any platform that has a web browser. It has some quirks and has gotten slower over the years, so I don't use it very much now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite is Sequel Pro (&lt;a href="http://www.sequelpro.com"&gt;http://www.sequelpro.com&lt;/a&gt;). It's free. I wish it could identify foreign keys with a tooltip, like phpMyAdmin does, but it at least gives you a link, so you're one click away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one I like is Querious. (&lt;a href="http://www.araelium.com/querious/"&gt;http://www.araelium.com/querious/&lt;/a&gt;) I would use it more often but for a silly reason: i can't remember its name! I think it costs something, but not very much. It has a nice boxes-and-lines graphical schema view that Sequel Pro lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have downloaded other tools from the Apple Store, such as Toad, Metabase, LamaFree, and more. Most of them, I fire up, play with for a bit, then go back to my favourites above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this is helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
