Parentheses can be used in some situations, but as of 10.4.8, attempting to use parentheses around a compound select that is inside an IN() expression (for example) will not be parsed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;select * from people where id in (
    (select id from people where name = 'foo')
    union
    (select id from people where name = 'bar'))
&lt;/pre&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Leifer</dc:creator><guid>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/except/+comments/4217</guid></item></channel></rss>
