&lt;p&gt;It gives you pretty much full access to MySQL, although it doesn't know much about MariaDB extensions. It is written in php, so you'll need access to the httpd server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, if you have Internet login credentials to the database, I don't think it matters where PhpMyAdmin is installed. You &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;could&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; even install it on your local machine, if you are willing to fire up an httpd server on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most well-installed mysqld servers are going to be well protected, and probably not accessible over the Internet, unless you can run a VPN to them.&lt;/p&gt;
