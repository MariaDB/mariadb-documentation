- Using MySQL cluster
- Using the federated storage engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in both cases things will get slower when you do joins across data that is in two machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ways to solve your problem depends on what storage engine you are using, the size of the buffers and how big your table_open_cache and table_definition_cache is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some storage engines, like MyISAM, you can put different tables in different key caches which ensures that using one big table doesn't flush out the others.&lt;/p&gt;
