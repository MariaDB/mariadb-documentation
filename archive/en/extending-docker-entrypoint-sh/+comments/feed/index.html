Seems Docker Library people currently want to take your current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd need to effectively add source oldentrypoint.sh, and copy most of _main to your entrypoint with changes to run each time it starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There probably be large simplifications of this by requesting the original wrapping initialization up into its own function. Feel free to make those non-impacting changes as a pull request - &lt;a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker"&gt;https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding intialization based on mariadb-backups (&lt;a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker/issues/522#issuecomment-1647045650"&gt;https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker/issues/522#issuecomment-1647045650&lt;/a&gt;) is going to be another largish change so having intialization in a separate function is going be easier to maintain compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
