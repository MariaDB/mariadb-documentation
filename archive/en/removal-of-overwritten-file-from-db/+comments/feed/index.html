Use SQL otherwise it will break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your state now I'd try a backup and restore.&lt;/p&gt;

What statements did you run, what errors did you receive? There's certainly a way to remove anything from the database - see the &lt;a href="/kb/en/delete/"&gt;DELETE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/kb/en/drop/"&gt;DROP&lt;/a&gt; statements for example, but as to how that integrates with RadioDJ and the folders you mention, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
