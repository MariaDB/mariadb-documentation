I have attached a picture that I think will show more clearly what I want to do.  I am not sure that it is even possible.
Any suggestions/insights any one has would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the masters are connected intermittently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't have configuration options that in the server. The (potential) master servers just need to be configured with --log-bin and it's up to DBA to provide topology.
Consider MaXScale as automation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
