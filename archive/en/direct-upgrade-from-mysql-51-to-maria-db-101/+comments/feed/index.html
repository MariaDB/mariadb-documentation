The main concern with skipping versions is that, while upgrading one major version is usually well-tested, skipping versions is not, so you may bump into an incompatibility. I suggest carefully going through the changes in each release to see if any could affect you: &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/"&gt;5.3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;5.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/"&gt;10.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/"&gt;10.1&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility/"&gt;MariaDB versus MySQL - Compatibility&lt;/a&gt;. Many people have successfully done what you intend, but it depends entirely on your usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/3. InnoDB is very different to MyISAM. It's much more robust, and there's usually no need to check and repair in the same way. See &lt;a href="/kb/en/converting-tables-from-myisam-to-innodb/"&gt;Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="/kb/en/xtradbinnodb-recovery-modes/"&gt;XtraDB/InnoDB Recovery Modes&lt;/a&gt; for what happens when innoDB detects corruption. Usually you would need to restore from backup (drop and reload).&lt;/p&gt;
