After all, it will use other tables than the rest of the applications so there shouldn't be any conflicting locks. In the worst case you can fire up another independent MariaDB server and have zabbix write it's results there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any system monitoring tool that monitors disk and memory should help you see the pressure on the system.  If that isn't enough, you should consider using Navicat, Monyog or any of the other available MariaDB/MySQL monitoring tools that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend that you use agent-less monitoring.  It's advantageous over traditional monitoring tools because it doesn't place any burden on your DB server(s). My personal preference is Navicat Monitor - &lt;a href="https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-monitor"&gt;https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-monitor&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can collect many database metrics as well as O/S metrics such as CPU load, RAM usage, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it includes numerous other features like alerts, reports, a query analyzer, replication monitoring, and LDAP/AD Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best regards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;
