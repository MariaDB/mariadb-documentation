ERROR 1105 (HY000): Table type TBL is not indexable!!!
and after that, i just deleted all the indexes from the Connect table schema and then i got  the 4th (last) problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to use Connect engine to "connect" two TokuDB tables with exact the same structure (i have done this successfully with 2 MyISAM tables and Merge Engine) to gain the parallel insertion speed of such an employment (insert to two underlying tables, query the one who "sees" them - Merge/Connect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Merge engine setup, the only difference was that i had to make the auto_increment primary key of the 2 MyISAM tables into a simple key in the definition of the Merge table. Sadly, that was not the case with the setup on the Connect table. Issues i encountered were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)Storage engine CONNECT doesn't support AUTO_INCREMENT columns. (i just erased this index from both the TokuDB tables and the Connect one - its for testing so no problem)
2)Unknown option 'CLUSTERING': the 2 underlying TokuDB tables had 5 clustering indexes each (defined the same) and at the definition of the Connect TBL type table this was not recognised. (i just erased the clustering=YES to the table schema of the Connect table)
3) Table handler doesn't support NULL in given index -&amp;gt;Why not! But well i changed some of the definitions i had: column int(3) default null, to: 
column int(3) not null default '0', and not a problem anymore.
4)After all that, i got the: Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) (the loaded table schema for Connect engine was OK), but when i executed: show table status; i got -&amp;gt; ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query. 
I suppose this happens because the Connect engine is corrupted or something!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any suggestion that may make my setup functional using the new Connect engine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, John.&lt;/p&gt;
