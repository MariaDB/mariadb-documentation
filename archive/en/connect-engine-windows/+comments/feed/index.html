Just entering "INSTALL SONAME 'ha_connect';" in the CLI installs it.&lt;/p&gt;

As a matter of fact, CONNECT is developed on Windows, then adapted for other OS. Some of its features are specific or more adapted to Windows:
- The WMI and MAC table types are Windows only.
- XML tables can use the Windows DOMDOC support (libxml2 on all OS is often not implemented for 64 bits machines)
- ODBC is a native Windows feature. On Unix/Linux it was test tested only with unixODBC that must be manually installed. &lt;/p&gt;
