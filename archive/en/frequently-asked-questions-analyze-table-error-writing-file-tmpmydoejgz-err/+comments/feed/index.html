did you manage to solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You created table as innodb and you have enough space (so your configuration in `/etc/my.cnf` related to innodb have nothing to do with this), but creating the temporary files (maybe?) fails to write a table for engine-independent table statistics (EITS) that happens to be a MyISAM table (according to the error you are receiving `/tmp/MYdOeJgz`). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your `/dev/...` ? 
Are you sure `/tmp/` is on the right place and did you manage to mount it on the right place?
Can you please provide the option file you are using?&lt;/p&gt;
