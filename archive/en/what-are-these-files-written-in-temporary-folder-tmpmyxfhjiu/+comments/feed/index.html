It means if that MariaDB is suddenly stopped there is no cleanup to do. They might be big, but there's nothing to suggest they won't finish eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the cause look at the &lt;a href="/kb/en/show-processlist/"&gt;SHOW PROCESSLIST&lt;/a&gt; for the ones running a long time (they might have a status that says something about temporary tables). Use &lt;a href="/kb/en/show-explain/"&gt;SHOW EXPLAIN FOR {threadid}&lt;/a&gt; so see what they are doing. Look for temporary table activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this is occurring after a bunk load. Make its the query plan statistics that are confused/lost and sub-optimal queries requiring temporary tables are occuring. Try an &lt;a href="/kb/en/analyze-table/"&gt;ANALYZE TABLE {table}&lt;/a&gt; as part of the import process.&lt;/p&gt;
