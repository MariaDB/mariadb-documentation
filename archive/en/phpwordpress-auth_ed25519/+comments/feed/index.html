Or really, all 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's misleading to state that MariaDB "generally works well" with PHP when there is this unmentioned-glaring security hole there when using them together. And unfortunately, I'm sure a lot of people won't recognize it and just use the mysql_native_password method thinking it's still okay.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a pity that PHP doesn't support auth_ed25519, and hopefully this will be fixed in future.&lt;/p&gt;
