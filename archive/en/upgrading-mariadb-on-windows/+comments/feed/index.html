It's a VM that I've been able to clone and test multiple times by reverting snapshots.  I've gradually worked my way forward and found the service upgrade works with the latest versions of 10.2 through 10.5, all the way up to 10.6.12.  I get the error if I try 10.6.13 or 10.6.14. Once I had a working 10.6.12 instance, I was able to upgrade in place to the latest version since it didn't require a service update. Version 10.6.12 was released in Feb, 10.6.13 in May and 10.6.14 in June.  These other comments align with that timeline.  Did something signficant change in the mysql_service_upgrade process between Feb and May that was propagated across versions?&lt;/p&gt;

It fails or as it says ' ended prematurely because of an error.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, so what is the error, where are the log files created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only option I changed was to not create a new database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help it I cannot see the full error details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the mysql_upgrade_service --service=MySQL_10.2 from the BIN folder of the new installation and got the 8 phases with a "Service 'MySQL_10.2' successfully upgraded" and started the service from service.msc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Heidi and I have a blank database. How would I reattach my data and bring in the users from my v10.1.2 2 instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also tried running the mysql_upgrade_wizard.exe from the same BIN folder, but that said there is no service that can be upgraded to Mariad DB 10.2.0, which I assume is because I completed it from the command line, previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advie would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Install new version, while still retaining the old one
2. Upgrade services one by one, like described later in the document (e.g with mysql_upgrade_service). It is recommeded to have services cleanly shut down before the upgrade.
3. Uninstall old version when previous step is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were looking into performing step 3, but halted when we noticed that certain configurations still refrered to the Maria Db 10.5 installation folder. These references were found in the my.ini file (path to Data folder and path to plugin folders) and also in the Windows service (Executable is the 10.6 folder, but is starts with parameter with my.ini in 10.5 folder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would expect, following the reccomendations, that these settings would be updatet too. We are now reluctant of removing the old version, before knowing what changes to configrations must be made prior to the removal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone clarify on this?&lt;/p&gt;

The problem is that you have no services to upgrade, on some reason the wizard decides that  whatever you got is not upgradable.  Those reasons could be executable name, different from mysqld.exe in the service config, or missing  or unparsable my.ini , or it could not find data directory. Unfortunately, the wizard does not log its decisions, on why it excluded something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no , you should not uninstall old version before installing new, or everything that is written here, and mysql_upgrade_service.exe tool would not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

When I upgrade from 10.1.22 to 10.6.4 I run the 10.6.4 msi, have no services to upgrade, then when I run the 10.1.22 msi and choose to Remove the version (but keep the data) I end up with the Windows Service uninstalled, so my 10.6.4 version will not work.  Are these steps out of date?  Should the uninstall of 10.1.22 happen first, keeping the data, then install 10.6.4?&lt;/p&gt;

Phase 1/10: Stopping service
Phase 2/10: Fixing server config file
Phase 3/10: Ensuring innodb slow shutdown,this can take some time
Phase 4/10: Starting mysqld for upgrade
Phase 5/10: Waiting for startup to complete
Phase 6/10: Running mysql_upgrade
Phase 7/10: Changing service configuration
Phase 8/10: Initiating server shutdown
Phase 9/10: Waiting for shutdown to complete
Phase 10/10: Starting service
Service 'MariaDB' successfully upgraded.
Log file is written to C:\Users\ADMINI1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\mysql_upgrade_service.MariaDB.log&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To install a minor upgrade, e.g &lt;strong&gt;10.1.27&lt;/strong&gt; on top of existing 10.1.26, with MSI, just download the &lt;strong&gt;10.1.26 MSI&lt;/strong&gt; and start it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouldn't it say:&lt;/p&gt;

Just went from 10.4.8 to 10.5.5. The wizard didn't work for me though, just threw an error that didn't explain the problem (it literally says "Fatal Error" - "mysql_upgrade_service returned error for service [service name]:" and nothing else, then closes when I click OK. Maybe it didn't like the space in the service name?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the bye, if you want to be able to back up your MariaDB databases without shutting them down first and without corrupting them, VSS is your friend.  Simply flush updates and lock the tables (FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK), create the VSS snapshot, then unlock (UNLOCK TABLES).  You can then go in after the fact and copy data to your backup storage. I use this method to refresh my QA and DEVEL instances and it's never given me drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works for me. 
Can I suggest to open bug in JIRA in investigate your case, so we do not spam the KB with "bug reports".&lt;/p&gt;

Phase 1/8: Changing service configuration
FATAL ERROR: Not a valid MySQL service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even reinstalled the MariaBD database onto another machine from scratch and moved the database across.  ODD!  Have updated from 10.0.15 to 10.0.36 fine and the service is currently running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All service related messages are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenSCManager failed with...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenService failed with...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;QueryServiceConfig failed with...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not a valid MySQL service
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can not downgrade, the service is currently running as version... my version is ...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ChangeServiceConfig failed with..
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one is yours ?&lt;/p&gt;

Says the service doesn't exist.... defiantly running a MariaDB database service and have access via tools like Heidi.  Not sure what could be stopping the upgrade service from seeing the service.&lt;/p&gt;

mysql_upgrade_service --service=name_of_your_service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tried the next major step up 10.1.34, Installed the versions side by side but get -  "There is no service that can be upgraded to &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-10134-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.1.34&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where on earth do i go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
