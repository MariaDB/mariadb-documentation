&lt;p&gt;1) Which MariaDB version are you using? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Please share screenshot of mysql_secure_installation and also share data which is entered at this time &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) I request you to please clarify your query i.e. "but if I add those it ask me for root pwd"&lt;/p&gt;
