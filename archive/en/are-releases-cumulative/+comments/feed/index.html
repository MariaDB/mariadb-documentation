&lt;p&gt;Changes in major release 10.2 for instance are merged up to 10.3 all the way up to the latest before release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such any fix/enhancement in a lower major version are carried though to the higher versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
