This is a second instance of the server not a client connection. It won't succeed, and that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a fresh install use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo mariadb -u root&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed by the following if want a root password&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set password = password('myPassword');&lt;/p&gt;

After confirming that use the ls -laZ to look at the selinux (&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/selinux/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/selinux/&lt;/a&gt;) labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to sudo restorecon -Rv /var/lib/mysql    before starting the service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you first try running:
sudo mariadb -u root&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the server running and see if you get access?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't work, stop mariadbd and restart the server with --skip-grant-tables option. This will make the server accept any incoming connection. Make sure the server can not be accessed from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Login to the server and run 
select * from mysql.global_priv table.
This will help in understanding what sort of authentication setup you have for your server and we can then debug further.&lt;/p&gt;
