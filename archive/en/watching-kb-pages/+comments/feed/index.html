If not, let me know and I'll look into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll just mark the whole question answered and yes, feel free to email me directly if you have any more questions or issues. bryan [at] mariadb [dot] com&lt;/p&gt;

I am not seeing categories yet. Do I need to do something first to enable that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what to do about selecting an "answer". Should we just delete the whole thread? And continue any other conversation off-wiki?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your idea to display the categories on the source / edit page is good and I'll implement that. Users with access have a page for that but the majority of users do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default we restrict users from editing categories because it was more difficult to rollback bad changes to categories then content and a few other reasons. However, you have been contributing good work and we really appreciate that so I have marked you as a "trusted" contributor and you should have a few more permissions now, including the ability to create and edit categories. Thanks for your support of MariaDB!&lt;/p&gt;

For category pages, I want to know when a new page is added to the category (which, if you system is MediaWiki-like may not be possible), and whether text is added (if the system allows that kind of thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the unclarity of my other question. Currently the categories assigned to a page are not visible to us when we click on Edit or Source. The Embedding categories in categories page says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For category pages with lots of entries, it may make sense to organize things under various headings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this we have created the ability to embed categories in their parent category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the Data Types page for an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the ability to do this is restricted to admins, but if you come across a category page that could benefit from this, please contact us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if the categories could be displayed in the source coe for the page, and whether users would be allowed to create and edit categories.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree it is confusing that there is no indication that you are watching and have added an "unwatch" button to that same spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently no page to view / manage all subscriptions but I've added it to the todo. Should be simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently only individual pages can be watched. If you watched a category would you want to be notified just any time a new page was added in that category? Or if any of the content of a page in that category was changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate question: Any chance of opening up categories to us? At least for display, if not editing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry but I don't quite understand this question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It refers to the page only. If I recall, a few pages on the KB have a different license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/about-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/+license/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/about-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/+license/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear if that page only relates to &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/about-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/about-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/&lt;/a&gt;, or to all KB pages.&lt;/p&gt;

These are some pages that I have noticed do not have a Watch Page button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/about-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/about-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/create-table/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/create-table/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/choosing-the-right-storage-engine/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/choosing-the-right-storage-engine/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;category pages, such as:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/create/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/create/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/storage-engines/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/storage-engines/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/storage-engines-storage-engine-development/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/storage-engines-storage-engine-development/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going t try to add the Watch button myself, but the code for it on the pages where it does appear is not visible to me. I would be happy to add them if you opened that up to us volunteer editors. Otherwise, when I run across currently unwatchable pages, should I make a comment about that on that page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait a minute, I just realized something. The 3 non-category pages I listed above were all pages I edited recently. ...[checking]... Never mind. I was already watching those pages. No wonder there was no Watch Page button! Would it be possible to put an Unwatch Pate button, or a text label in the same spot to alert the viewer they s/he is already watching the page? Also, is there one page a viewer can go to see all the pages s/he is watching, a la Wikipedia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate question: Any chance of opening up categories to us? At least for display, if not editing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
