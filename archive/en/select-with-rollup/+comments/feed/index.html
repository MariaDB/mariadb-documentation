&lt;p&gt;That's not much of a workaround, since coalesce is a completely different operation which leads to incorrect results.  Specifically, coalesce fails to differentiate between nulls in data and nulls generated by the roll up.  Coalesce also cannot be used in a having clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MariaDB desperately needs to add the grouping function, as common queries are not possible to write correctly without it.&lt;/p&gt;

In absence of that you may use a workaround.
Wrap the query in a SELECT COALESCE(Country, 'All Countries'),COALESCE(year,'All Years),COALESCE(genre,'All Genred') FROM (.....) AS T;&lt;/p&gt;
