I have a use case of hybrid replication. I have two mariadb galera clusters located in two different data centers e.g 1) California and 2) in London. These two clusters are connected by WAN. Within both the galera clusters - the mariadb's standard synchronous replication works very smoothly. Between two clusters I configured a master and slave using standard setting of mariadb async replication. This also worked well - i.e. it replicated information from Master galera node(Based in London) to slave node(based in california). But once I get data on slave node, I expect that due to synchronous replication within the galera cluster located in california,  it should replicate the data to other galera nodes as well. which is not happening. Can someone please help with this?&lt;/p&gt;
