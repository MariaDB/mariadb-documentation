&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;docker exec --user mysql -ti test-db bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are uid maps, the only root (or faked root) priv required is the changing of file permissions/ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm even looking at making these non-fatal - &lt;a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker/pull/595"&gt;https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker/pull/595&lt;/a&gt; - but this would have showed up differently in your logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad the 11.4 container is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yeah - i think i once also tried to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;docker exec -ti test-db bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and try to kill the process - but get the same permission denied.
such *not possible to kill* scenarios can also come from some sort of io-problem:
the process is in a *read or write* operation that the kernel can not stop.
i had this on my development-laptop long time ago with some very experimental setup..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my os and docker are - i think - up to date:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;as already posted - with the 11.4 image it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am with you - it is really odd..
maybe something to do with *root* creating the volume and therefore the directories and files - and somehow this root is different when rootless is in play...?!
for now i try to just use the current lts version&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;docker-entrypoint.sh: line 149: kill: (109) - Permission denied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 109 is the process of the temporary server started which is in the logs. There hasn't been any change in user. So its effectively the entry-point running a background mysqld process and then not being able to kill the same process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently the docker root mode doesn't hit this "Permission denied".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at upgrading your OS and docker version. Something seems incompatible there though I can't pinpoint what it might be.&lt;/p&gt;

with the current lts (mariadb:11.4) it seems working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
