At very high volumes, binlog replay performance can be negatively affected when compression is turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenario is most obvious with row-based logging, table space encryption, and annotations turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing MIXED replication with annotations + compression, you will get the best performance with compression OFF and annotations OFF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless disk space and network links are limited, would suggest leaving compression off. For reference, our peak volumes are around 300k Insert/Update/Deletes per minute.&lt;/p&gt;

The row annotations were easily doubling the size of my binlogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you may have wrong impression that something is not working as expected, because log size will stay the same, but in fact everything is ok, just your db traffic may not always be"compressible" using this approach...&lt;/p&gt;
