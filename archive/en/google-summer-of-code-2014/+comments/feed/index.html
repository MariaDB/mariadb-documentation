Maria DB got my due interest and attention when I read about Google replaced many of its MY SQL server instances with Maria DB. I have strong database development background with respect to its usage but I never have my own implementation and I'd love to learn and contribute here. My most interesting topic here is [Indexes for BLOBs (in MyISAM and Aria)]. I am good at data structures which might be of help here certainly. Please give me the opportunity and lets discuss the details.  &lt;/p&gt;

I would like to work with MariaDB this summer. am interested in open source projects. I am interested to work on the research topic titled: 'Statistically optimize mysql-tests runs by running less tests'. I'm proficient in C,C++ and familiar with sql. and I look forward to learn more by working with you..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

I am a post graduate Student studying in IIIT Hyderabad, India with 2 years of work experience in Symantec and GSlabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested in working for CREATE OR REPLACE, CREATE IF NOT EXISTS, and DROP IF EXISTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on implementation of a database system engine which simulates the features of Database system in java. It uses indices and different algorithms for Best results.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks

Of course, I have a certain idea about what should be done and how — see &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-350"&gt;MDEV-350&lt;/a&gt; — but you are free to suggest a different approach and convince me that it is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This task doesn't need a deep understanding of the MariaDB optimizer, so one should be able to start coding quickly, certainly within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

my name is Manuel and I am a student of Computer Science at the Univeristy of Innsbruck, Austria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually got some basic knowledge of databases from university. I even did a class in which we implemented a small database in Java for education purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am used to write C code, know object-oriented programming paradigms, but however are a little bit rusty in C++. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one project, I'm most interested in is listed as "Self-Tuning Optimizer". I am acutally wondering if the learning algorithm to be inplemented  is already known in detail or if I could develop one one my own (with respect to the well known machine learning algorithms)? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually sounds like a quite complex task. However, when implemented properly it might be a nice (possilby even big) advantage of MariaDB compared to other databases. Currently, I'm not familiar with the code of MariaDB. How long do you expect that I need on digging through the code before I know enough to be able to start coding (I know that's quite hard to predict, but I'd like to have some options from you)?&lt;/p&gt;

Can you suggest some links where I can read more about "Improved temporary tables" &amp;amp; "Table UDFs".&lt;/p&gt;

I am Nurlan from Kazakhstan. I wish good luck to each participant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@sergii, @holyfoot, could you provide "MariaDB management console snapin and WMI Provider (Windows)" as additional project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be really good if I will get some information related to Java Connector related tasks before 10th March so that preparation for proposal can be started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards
Puneet.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll add Connector/J related tasks here. But they need a mentor, that's what I'm looking for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw some bugs related to JDBC 1.1.6.But those seems to be fixed.
Can you suggest some links where I can find more information about the future tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards
Puneet.&lt;/p&gt;

I am Talina from India, and I would love to work on the "Active Directory authentication plugin". 
Could you kindly suggest me some suitable links to start from? Also how can I connect to the mentors? 
Thanks! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Camelia and I am interested in developing the Self-Tuning Optimizer for MariaDB. In the following days I will come back for further discussion of the approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best regards, Camelia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Masters student from National University of Singapore with over 2.7 years of experience in Java and Java EE applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will like to work on the mysql-Java connector for MariaDb.
Please suggest some suitable links to start from.
Meanwhile I have started investigating into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your suggestions will be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards
Puneet.&lt;/p&gt;
