Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also just to confirm, there are no new reserved words in 10.8 through 11.6, correct? (currently the latest entry here is ROW_NUMBER from &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-107/"&gt;MariaDB 10.7&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

I looked at sql/lex.h but some of those strings are not keywords (like ACTION).&lt;/p&gt;
