See also **[[mariadb-vs-mysql-features | MariaDB vs MySQL - Features]]**
&lt;&lt;/style&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;toc&gt;&gt;

== Replacement for MySQL

Until MariaDB 5.5, MariaDB versions functioned as a &#34;drop-in replacement&#34; for the equivalent MySQL version, with some limitations. From MariaDB 10.0, it is usually still very easy to upgrade from MySQL.

* MariaDB&#39;s data files are generally binary compatible with those from the equivalent MySQL version.
** All filenames and paths are generally the same.
** Data and table definition files (.frm) files are binary compatible.
** See note below for an incompatibility with views!

* MariaDB&#39;s client protocol is binary compatible with MySQL&#39;s client protocol.
** All client APIs and structs are identical.
** All ports and sockets are generally the same.
** All MySQL connectors (PHP, Perl, Python, Java, .NET, MyODBC, Ruby, MySQL C
  connector etc) work unchanged with MariaDB.
** There are some [[installation-issues-with-php5|installation issues with PHP5]]
   that you should be aware of (a bug in how the old PHP5 client checks library
   compatibility).

This means that for many cases, you can just uninstall MySQL and [[getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb|install MariaDB]] and you are good to go. There is not generally any need to convert any data files.

However, you must still run [[mysql_upgrade|mysql_upgrade]] to finish the upgrade. This is needed to ensure that your mysql privilege and event tables are updated with the new fields MariaDB uses.

That said, MariaDB has a lot of [[mariadb-versus-mysql-features|new options, extension, storage engines and bug fixes]] that are not in MySQL. You can find the feature set for the different MariaDB
versions on the [[what-is-in-the-different-mariadb-releases|What is in the different MariaDB Releases]] page.

=== Drop-in Compatibility of Specific MariaDB Versions

MariaDB 10.2, MariaDB 10.3, and MariaDB 10.4 function as limited drop-in replacements for MySQL 5.7, as far as [[innodb|InnoDB]] is concerned. However, the implementation differences continue to grow in each new MariaDB version.

MariaDB 10.0 and MariaDB 10.1 function as limited drop-in replacements for MySQL 5.6, as far as [[innodb|InnoDB]] is concerned. However, there are some implementation differences in some features.

MariaDB 5.5 functions as a drop-in replacement for MySQL 5.5.

MariaDB 5.1, MariaDB 5.2, and MariaDB 5.3 function as drop-in replacements for MySQL 5.1.

== Replication Compatibility

[[replication-overview|Replication]] compatibility depends on:

* The MariaDB Server version
* The MySQL Server version
* The role of each server

Replication compatibility details are described below for each MySQL version that is still maintained.

For replication compatibility details between MariaDB versions, see [[replication-overview#cross-version-replication-compatibility|Cross-Version Replication Compatibility]].

=== MySQL 5.7

MariaDB Server 10.2 and later can replicate from a MySQL 5.7 primary server.

MariaDB Server does not support the MySQL implementation of Global Transaction IDs (GTIDs), so the MariaDB replica server must use the binary log file and position for replication. If GTID mode is enabled on the MySQL primary server, the MariaDB replica server will remove the MySQL GTID events and replace them with MariaDB GTID events.

Although MariaDB Server and MySQL 5.7 are compatible at the replication level, they may have some incompatibilities at the SQL (detailed below). Those differences can cause replication failures in some cases. To decrease the risk of compatibility issues, it is recommended to set [[replication-and-binary-log-system-variables#binlog_format|binlog_format]] to ##ROW##. When you want to replicate from MySQL 5.7 to MariaDB Server, it is recommended to test your application, so that any compatibility issues can be found and fixed.

MariaDB can&#39;t make any claims about whether a MySQL 5.7 replica server can replicate from a MariaDB primary server.

=== MySQL 8.0

Before MariaDB 10.6.21, MariaDB Server could not replicate from a MySQL 8.0 primary server, because MySQL 8.0 has a binary log format that is incompatible.

MariaDB 10.6.21 and newer can replicate from a MySQL 8.0 server as long as the following
holds:
* Columns of type JSON are not supported. One should change these to TEXT.
* One should set ##binlog-row-value-options=&#34;&#34;##. This disables the incompatible ##PARTIAL_UPDATE_ROWS_EVENT## event.
* One should set ##binlog_transaction_compression=0##. This disables the incompatible ##TRANSACTION_PAYLOAD_EVENT## event.
 * One should not use the MySQL 8.0 utf8mb4_ja_0900_... collations when replicating to MariaDB 10.6 - MariaDB 11.4.4.  MariaDB 11.4.5 and above will support most of the MySQL 8.0 utf8mb4_ja_0900_... collations.

== Incompatibilities between Currently Maintained MariaDB Versions and MySQL

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB Rolling and MySQL 8.0

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB 10.1 and MySQL 5.7

* MariaDB 10.1 and above does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s packed JSON objects.  MariaDB follows the SQL standard and stores the JSON as a normal TEXT/BLOB.  If you want to replicate JSON columns from MySQL to MariaDB, you should store JSON objects in MySQL in a TEXT column or use statement based replication.  If you are using JSON columns and want to upgrade to MariaDB, you can either convert the JSON columns to TEXT or use [[mysqldump]] to copy these tables to MariaDB. In MySQL, JSON is compared according to json values. In MariaDB JSON strings are normal strings and compared as strings.
* MariaDB 10.1&#39;s InnoDB encryption is implemented differently than MySQL 5.7&#39;s InnoDB encryption.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support the ngram and MeCab full-text parser plugins - MDEV-10267, MDEV-10268.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support multiple triggers for a table - MDEV-6112. This is fixed in MariaDB 10.2
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support [[create-tablespace|CREATE TABLESPACE]] for InnoDB.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s “native” InnoDB partitioning handler. Fixed  in MariaDB 10.6.15.
* MariaDB does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s X protocol.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support the use of multiple triggers of the same type for a table.  This feature was introduced in MariaDB 10.2.2.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s transportable tablespaces for partitioned InnoDB tables.  ALTER TABLE ... {DISCARD|IMPORT} PARTITION is not supported. For a workaround [[http://www.geoffmontee.com/importing-innodb-partitions-in-mysql-5-6-and-mariadb-10-010-1/|see the following blog post]].
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s online undo tablespace truncation.  However, this feature was added to MariaDB 10.2.
* MySQL 5.7 features a new implementation of the ##performance_schema## and a ##sys ## schema wrapper.  These are not yet supported in MariaDB.
* MySQL 5.7 adds multi-source replication and replication channels.  [[multi-source-replication|Multi-source replication]] was added to MariaDB previously, in MariaDB 10.0, and uses a different syntax.
* MySQL 5.7 adds group replication.  This feature is incompatible with MariaDB&#39;s [[Galera Cluster|galera-cluster]] replication.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s, ##ACCOUNT LOCK/UNLOCK## synax for ##CREATE USER## and ##ALTER USER## statements.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s ##ALTER TABLE...RENAME INDEX## statements.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s ##STACKED## operation for ##[[get-diagnostics|GET DIAGNOSTICS]]## statements.
* MariaDB 10.1 does not support MySQL 5.7&#39;s ##{WITH|WITHOUT} VALIDATION## syntax for ##ALTER TABLE.. EXCHANGE PARTITION## statements.
* MariaDB does not support the optional //init_vector// argument for [[aes_encrypt|AES_ENCRYPT]] and [[aes_decrypt|AES_DECRYPT]] or the block_encryption_mode variable - MDEV-9069
* MariaDB does not support the ##--initialize## option. Use ##[[mysql_install_db]]## instead. - MDEV-19010
* Also see Incompatibilities between MariaDB 10.0 and MySQL 5.6.
* Also see a detailed breakdown of [[system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-101-and-mysql-57|System variable differences between MariaDB 10.1and MySQL 5.7]].

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB 10.0 and MySQL 5.6

* MySQL does not support MariaDB&#39;s [[spider|Spider Storage Engine]].
* All MySQL binaries (&lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;mysqld&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt;, [[myisamchk|myisamchk]] etc.) give a warning if one uses a prefix of an option (such as &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;--big-table&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt; instead of &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;--big-tables&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt;). MariaDB binaries work in the same way as most other Unix commands and don&#39;t give warnings when using unique prefixes.
* MariaDB GTID is not compatible with MySQL 5.6.  This means that one can&#39;t have MySQL 5.6 as a slave for MariaDB 10.0. However MariaDB 10.0 can be a slave of MySQL 5.6 or any earlier MySQL/MariaDB version. Note that MariaDB and MySQL also have different [[gtid#system-variables-for-global-transaction-id|GTID system variables]], so these need to be adjusted when migrating.
* MariaDB 10.0 [[multi-source-replication|multi-source replication]] is not supported in MySQL 5.6.
* To make CREATE TABLE ... SELECT work the same way in statement based and row based replication it&#39;s by default executed as [[create-table#create-or-replace|CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE]] on the slave.  One benefit of this is that if the slave dies in the middle of CREATE ... SELECT it will be able to continue.
** One can use the [[replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables#slave_ddl_exec_mode|slave-ddl-exec-mode]] variable to specify how &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;DROP TABLE&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt; is replicated.
* See also a detailed breakdown of [[system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-100-and-mysql-56|System variable differences between MariaDB 10.0 and MySQL 5.6]].
* MySQL 5.6 has [[performance-schema|performance schema]] enabled by default. For performance reasons MariaDB 10.0 has it disabled by default. You can enable it by starting &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;mysqld&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt; with the option &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;--performance-schema&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt;.
* MariaDB 10.0 does not support the MySQL Memcached plugin. However, data stored using memcached can be retrieved because the data is stored as InnoDB tables. MariaDB is able to start successfully with an error message of not being able to find libmemcached.so library.
* Users created with MySQL&#39;s SHA256 password algorithm cannot be used in MariaDB 10.0 as MariaDB does not include MySQL&#39;s ##sha256_password## plugin.
* MariaDB 10.0 does not support delayed replication - MDEV-7145.
* Also see a detailed breakdown of [[system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-100-and-mysql-56|System variable differences between MariaDB 10.0 and MySQL 5.6]].
* The low-level temporal format used by TIME, DATETIME and TIMESTAMP is different in MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB 10.0. (In MariaDB 10.1, the MySQL implementation is used by default - see [[server-system-variables/#mysql56_temporal_format|mysql56_temporal_format]].)
* MariaDB implements some changes in the SQL query optimizer over what&#39;s available in MySQL.  This can result in ##[[explain|EXPLAIN]]## statements showing different plans.
* MySQL delayed replication, (through ##MASTER_DELAY##), is not supported in MariaDB 10.0, it was implemented in MariaDB 10.2.5
* MariaDB does not support the optional //init_vector// argument for [[aes_encrypt|AES_ENCRYPT]] and [[aes_decrypt|AES_DECRYPT]] or the block_encryption_mode variable - MDEV-9069

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB 5.5 and MySQL 5.5

* **Views with definition ALGORITHM=MERGE or ALGORITHM=TEMPTABLE got accidentally swapped between MariaDB and MySQL!  You have to re-create views created with either of these definitions!**
* [[ignore|INSERT IGNORE]] also gives warnings for duplicate key errors. You can turn this off by setting &lt;&lt;fixed&gt;&gt;OLD_MODE=NO_DUP_KEY_WARNINGS_WITH_IGNORE&lt;&lt;/fixed&gt;&gt; (see [[old_mode|OLD_MODE]]).
* Before MariaDB 5.5.31, ##X&#39;HHHH&#39;##, the standard SQL syntax for binary string literals, erroneously worked in the same way as ##0xHHHH##, which could work as a number or string depending on the context. In 5.5.31 this was fixed to behave as a string in all contexts (and never as a number), introducing an incompatibility with previous versions of MariaDB, and all versions of MySQL. See [[cast|CAST]] and [[hexadecimal-literals|Hexadecimal Literals]] for more details and examples.
* MariaDB [[dynamic-columns-in-mariadb-10|dynamic columns]] are not supported by MySQL.
* MariaDB [[virtual-computed-columns|virtual columns]] are not supported by MySQL.
* MariaDB&#39;s [[handlersocket|HandlerSocket plugin]] is not supported by MySQL.
* MariaDB&#39;s [[cassandra|Cassandra Storage Engine]] is not supported by MySQL.
* As of MariaDB 5.5.35, [[extract|EXTRACT (HOUR FROM ...)]] adheres to the SQL standard and returns a result from 0 to 23. In MySQL, and earlier versions of MariaDB, the result can be greater than 23.
* See also a detailed breakdown of [[system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-55-and-mysql-55|System variable differences between MariaDB 5.5 and MySQL 5.5]].

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB 5.3 and MySQL 5.1

* **Views with definition ALGORITHM=MERGE or ALGORITHM=TEMPTABLE got accidentally swapped between MariaDB 5.2 and MariaDB 5.3!  You have to re-create views created with either of these definitions!**
* A few error messages related to wrong conversions are different as MariaDB
  provides more information in the message about what went wrong.
* Error numbers for MariaDB-specific errors have been moved to start from 1900 so as not to conflict with MySQL errors.
* Microseconds now work in all contexts; MySQL, in some contexts, lost the microsecond part from datetime and time.
* [[unix_timestamp|UNIX_TIMESTAMP]](constant-date-string) returns a timestamp with 6 decimals in MariaDB while MySQL returns it without a decimal. This can cause a problem if you are using UNIX_TIMESTAMP() as a partitioning function. You can fix this by using [[floor|FLOOR]](UNIX_TIMESTAMP(..)) or changing the date string to a date number, like 20080101000000.
* MariaDB performs stricter checking of date, datetime and timestamp values. For example [[unix_timestamp|UNIX_TIMESTAMP]](&#39;x&#39;) now returns NULL instead of 0.
* The old &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--maria-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; startup options are removed. You should use
  the &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--aria-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; prefix instead. (MariaDB 5.2 supports both &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--maria-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;
  and &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--aria-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;)
* ##[[show-processlist|SHOW PROCESSLIST]]## has an extra ##Progress## column
  which shows progress for some commands. You can disable it by
  starting ##mysqld## with either &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--old-mode=NO_PROGRESS_INFO&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; or with the &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--old&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; flag (see [[old_mode|OLD_MODE]]). 
* ##INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST## has three new columns for progress
  reporting: ##STAGE##, ##MAX_STAGE##, and ##PROGRESS##.
* [[comment-syntax|Long comments]] which start with &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;/*M!&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;
  or &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;/*M!#####&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; are executed.
* If you use [[server-system-variables#max_user_connections|max_user_connections=0]] (which means any number of connections) when starting mysqld, you can&#39;t change the global variable
  anymore while mysqld remains running. This is because when mysqld is started
  with &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;max_user_connections=0&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; it does not allocate counting
  structures (which also involve a mutex for each connection). This would lead
  to wrong counters if you later changed the variable. If you want to be able
  to change this variable at runtime, set it to a high value at startup.
* You can set &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;max_user_connections&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; (both the global variable
  and the ##GRANT## option) to ##-1## to stop users from connecting to the
  server. The global &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;max_user_connections&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; variable does not
  affect users with the &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;SUPER&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; privilege.
* The [[ignore|IGNORE]] directive does not ignore all errors (like fatal errors), only things that are safe to ignore.

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB 5.2 and MySQL 5.1

The list is the same as between MariaDB 5.1 and MySQL 5.1, with one addition:

* A new [[sql-mode|SQL_MODE]] value was added:
  &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;IGNORE_BAD_TABLE_OPTIONS&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;. If it is not set, using a table,
  field, or index attribute (option) that is not supported by the chosen
  storage engine will cause an error. This change might cause warnings in the
  error log about incorrectly defined tables from the &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;mysql&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;
  database, fix that with [[mysql_upgrade|mysql_upgrade]].

For all practical purposes, MariaDB 5.2 is a drop in replacement for MariaDB 5.1 and MySQL 5.1.

=== Incompatibilities between MariaDB 5.1 and MySQL 5.1

In some few cases MariaDB has to be incompatible to allow MariaDB to provide
more and better information than MySQL. 

Here is the list of all known user level incompatibilities you may see
when using MariaDB 5.1 instead of MySQL 5.1.

* The installation package names start with MariaDB instead of MySQL.
* Timings may be different as MariaDB is in many cases faster than MySQL.
* mysqld in MariaDB also reads the &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;[mariadb]&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; sections of your
  my.cnf files.
* You can&#39;t use a binary only storage engine library with MariaDB if it&#39;s not
  compiled for exactly the same MariaDB version. (This is because the server
  internal structure THD is different between MySQL and MariaDB. This is common
  also between different MySQL versions). This should not be a problem as most
  people don&#39;t load new storage engines and MariaDB comes with
  [[mariadb-storage-engines|more storage engines]] than MySQL.
* ##CHECKSUM TABLE## may give different result as MariaDB doesn&#39;t ignore NULL&#39;s
  in the columns as MySQL 5.1 does (Future MySQL versions should calculate
  checksums the same way as MariaDB). You can get the &#39;old style&#39; checksum in
  MariaDB by starting mysqld with the &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--old&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt; option. Note however that that
  the MyISAM and Aria storage engines in MariaDB are using the new checksum
  internally, so if you are using &lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;--old&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;, the ##CHECKSUM## command will be
  slower as it needs to calculate the checksum row by row.
* The slow query log has 
  [[slow-query-log-extended-statistics|more information]] about the query,
  which may be a problem if you have a script which parses the slow query log.
* MariaDB by default takes a bit more memory than MySQL because we have by
  default enabled the [[aria-formerly-known-as-maria|Aria storage engine]] for
  handling internal temporary tables. If you need MariaDB to take very little
  memory (at the expense of performance), you can set the value
  of ##aria_pagecache_buffer_size## to ##1M## (the default is ##128M##).
* If you are using [[mysqld-startup-options|new command options]],
  [[mariadb-versus-mysql-features|new features of MariaDB]] or
  [[mariadb-storage-engines|new storage engines]], you can&#39;t move easily back
  and forth between MySQL and MariaDB anymore.

== Old, Unsupported Configuration Options

If you are using any of the following options in your ##/etc/my.cnf## or other
##my.cnf## file you should remove them.  This is also true for MySQL 5.1 or
newer:

* ##skip-bdb##

== Replacing a MySQL RPM

If you uninstalled a MySQL RPM to install MariaDB, note that the MySQL RPM on
uninstall renames ##/etc/my.cnf## to ##/etc/my.cnf.rpmsave##.

After installing MariaDB you should do the following to restore your old
configuration options:

&lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;
mv -vi /etc/my.cnf.rpmsave /etc/my.cnf
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;

== Incompatibilities between MariaDB and MySQL-Proxy

A MySQL client API is able to connect to MariaDB using MySQL-Proxy but a MariaDB client API will receive progress reporting informations that MySQL-Proxy does not implement, to get full compatibility in all case just disable progress reporting on the client or server side. 

Another option is to use the [[maxscale|MariaDB MaxScale proxy]], that works with both MySQL and MariaDB.
