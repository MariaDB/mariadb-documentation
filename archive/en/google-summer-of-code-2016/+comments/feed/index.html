I am Alan John, a B.Tech student of IIT Bombay. The project on GIS enhancements captured my attention. As I read more about the Geographic Information System, I found it exciting and the different methods used for representing geographical features was a new knowledge for me. As I researched more I found that there are various formats for storing the information on maps and I realized the importance of this project i.e. to convert from one format to other without losing essential information and features. I am proficient in c, python and I have worked with mysql. Mariadb is new for me but I am confident of learning it in a few weeks. Please guide me through the project. I couldn’t find any prior discussion on this topic, if there is any, can somebody share a link with me. I would love to work hard on this project under the guidance of the mentors.
Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

You can start by getting to know MaxScale and the community around it (Google Group and IRC channel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good starting point would be to read &lt;a href="/kb/en/building-maxscale-from-source-code/"&gt;building-maxscale-from-source-code&lt;/a&gt; and after that, taking a look at the source code of the filters. Good examples of the filter module type are the qlafilter, topfilter and regexfilter.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to work on "Aggregate stored functions" project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I an good at MySQL and proficient enough in c++ so was looking forward to contribute to the project, as a part of GSoC 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write a proposal for this project.
Any help regarding whom to approach regarding this would be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Charles Dirk  a Computer Science student at the University of Cape Town.
I would love to add support for GTIDs to MariaDB HA. I am proficient in C/C++, Perl/Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I realized this feature is already supported in MySQL so initially I expected it to work with MariaDB until I realized MySQL and MariaDB have different formats for their GTIDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will write a proposal for this project hoping I will be given the opportunity to contribute to open source.
 I equally Look forward to talking more with the assigned mentor soon.&lt;/p&gt;
