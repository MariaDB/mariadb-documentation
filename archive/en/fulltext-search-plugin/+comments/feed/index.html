I have loaded FTPARSER plugin. There is no need to compile additional plugin as I thought before becouse this plugin is already included but with nothing meaning name "mypluglib.so" . 
But after that when I tried to create fulltext index with this parser I saw that process ends suddenly with disconnected database. I think that this plugin has some problems anyway. So this is closed road.&lt;/p&gt;

After build .so file I still get the same error "ERROR 1127 (HY000): Can't find symbol 'mysql_plugin_declarations' in library."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems this symbol has been replaced with _maria_plugin_declarations_.&lt;/p&gt;
