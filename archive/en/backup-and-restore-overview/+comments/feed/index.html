Note that Percona has deprecated TokuDB, so it will be removed in a future MariaDB version - &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19780"&gt;MDEV-19780&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Could you please let me know if that plugin is still available? If so, where could I download it from?
If not, how could I backup my toku tables from mariadb database?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

However, the mysql.* tables are using MyISAM. So the tables will be created OK on the node where you run the import, but replication to the other nodes will not work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

"To dump the buffer pool, the innodb_buffer_pool_load_now can be set to ON. To restore it, the innodb_buffer_pool_load_now can be set to ON."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the first should be innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now.&lt;/p&gt;

I am facing a strange issue here. I have setup a galera cluster with 3 nodes. As long as I am creating database/tables/ adding data directly to any of the galera nodes, it works fine. But when I import a mysqldump created sql from another database -using command like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mysql -uroot -p testDB&amp;lt;testDB.sql &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I face a strange issue. If I run import on primary node of the galera, i acn see data is imported properly on primary node. But when I try to verify the same on one of the secondary nodes, I realize that suddenly i am not allowed in using my old credentials.
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On more investigation, i realize that mysql.user table has been emptied on secondary node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MariaDB [mysql]&amp;gt; select * from mysql.user;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
(Ofcourse I had to start this node's mysql usng skip grant tables for this)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you please guide me what could be the issue here?&lt;/p&gt;
