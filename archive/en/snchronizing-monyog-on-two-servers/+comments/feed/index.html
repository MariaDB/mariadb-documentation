For this you can copy the Counters.def file as mentioned in the earlier post.  Sibin(Webyog)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A workaround would be to copy the “Counters.def” file under the MONyog folder of one MONyog instance to another. The “Counters.def” file will have the details regarding the counters that were added/created  in MONyog. The MONyog folder can be found at the following path based on the corresponding OS,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows:
C:\ProgramData\Webyog\MONyog\Counters.def&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux (For .rpm):
/usr/local/MONyog/Counters.def&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux (For .tar.gz)
Goto the directory where MONyog package is exctracted.. i.e., &amp;lt;MONyog exctracted folder&amp;gt;/Counters.def&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also write to support@webyog.com if you have any queries. Sibin (Webyog)&lt;/p&gt;
