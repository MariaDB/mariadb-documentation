I noted more recently a very negative impact of having too many persistent connections and when using the setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thread_definition_cache = -1;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That combined with the various table caches was taking up a bunch of space.  It seems the thread_definition_cache, over the period of a few days went to the max value, and never aged itself out.  So, the system memory use exploded till OOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up flushing the hosts and reducing the various caching variables until the system was healthy again.  This was version 10.5.12.&lt;/p&gt;

We also always mark in the "KB" in what release a specific feature was added.
This means that when one wants to read up on a feature, one can quickly skip the parts that does not affect the version that is used.  In addition one can quickly see the benefits one can get by upgrading MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't have the resources to maintain a manual per release.  Also doing it that way would make it almost impossible for the community to improve the manual (as they would have to do the changes in all releases, which is not practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 2018. Probably time to update this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As MariaDB has accelerated development, and are not afraid to remove and change things, I suggest that the web site / documentation be organized by major releases, and articles updates as new releases become Stable/GA. For example, separate documentation for 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
