&lt;p&gt;a two node cluster is susceptible to split brain - don't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a single node isn't a cluster so don't pretend it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction of your async replication isn't clear. If it goes in both you can't write to both at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could just make a 3 node cluster across the WAN and you may not have any troubles at all. Don't make assumptions that it won't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you initialised the slave isn't clear. Guessing a restore from mysqldump into a dc1 node that wasn't the replication master. However that occurred, taking a dump of nodeX_dc1 and loading into dc2 will probably clear your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This more of an architectural mess/fail question that is better asked on a mailing list rather an asking a specific question on an existing article or functionality that would benefit users of this wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
