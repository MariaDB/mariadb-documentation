A deadlock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS can report the latest deadlock. Does this look like the processes you are talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;READ COMMITTED can help will some, but not all forms of deadlock. As can specific indexing to ensure a minimial number of records are locked at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also handling deadlock exceptions in your application code is a good way of doing it. The deadlock handling depends on the application which is why the database doesn't do this automaticly.&lt;/p&gt;
