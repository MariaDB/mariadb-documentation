It's far from concise and to the point. Is this three sentence paraphrase correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating a storage engine for major MariaDB releases is time consuming, MariaDB has chosen to migrate InnoDB first, and it is complete. MariaDB has determined that migrating a second similar storage engine, XtraDB, is not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

task. It took us more than half a year to migrate from InnoDB-5.6 to
InnoDB-5.7 in 10.2. Doing it again for XtraDB would've required few more
months (although less than half a year). For us to embark on such
project, it must be bringing significant benefits to our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XtraDB had many great improvements over InnoDB in 5.1 and 5.5.  But over
time MySQL has implemented them all (or almost all), now InnoDB has
caught up and XtraDB is only marginally better. Not enough to justify a
multi-month merge that would delay 10.2-GA for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
