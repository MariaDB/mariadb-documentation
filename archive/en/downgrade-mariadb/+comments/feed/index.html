He just asked if we updated to &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/"&gt;MariaDB 10.1&lt;/a&gt; and I said yes and he said change it back to 10.0.21. That's all the information I was given. I will try to prod him more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to try and work through the issues and tweak settings to adjust. very few apps ever truly have issues unless the software uses a deprecated feature. &lt;/p&gt;

It could be something as simple a turning off some feature or adjusting some setting in my.cnf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of errors is your application "tossing?"&lt;/p&gt;
