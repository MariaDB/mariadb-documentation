Your suggestions have been helpful in that regard. I see that there are a lot of options that can be used for the &lt;em&gt;"slow log"&lt;/em&gt; that will help with the analysis of SQL statements. Thanks for responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this query (as one example of several) is not a problem as I don't see any performance issues. Just an attempt by me to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wrote: &lt;em&gt;"Contrary to the implication of phpmyadmin advice, you can't tune yourself out of every problem"&lt;/em&gt;. Quite true!!! In experimenting, I ran across several cases of conflicting advice. Additionally, some advise went away after MariaDB ran for a while. Part of the learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please include &lt;a href="/kb/en/show-create-table/"&gt;SHOW CREATE TABLE&lt;/a&gt; information for both tables.  If you want to cut this down to just the fields and indexes of the table that's ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="/kb/en/analyze-formatjson-examples/"&gt;ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON&lt;/a&gt; to show how the query is being executed. &lt;a href="/kb/en/slow-query-log-extended-statistics/#log_slow_verbosity"&gt;log_slow_verbosity&lt;/a&gt; can help get some extended information in the slow query log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the implication of phpmyadmin advice, you can't tune yourself out of every problem. You query returns the entire data from two entire tables. The recommendation on handler_read_rnd is based on the assumption you don't read entire tables often and that when MariaDB does read the entire tables, its because it isn't index right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this query really a problem? The table sizes seem quite small and I suspect you are getting less than a 10ms response time.&lt;/p&gt;
