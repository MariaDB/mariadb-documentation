MySQL 8 seems to continue to use VALUES for this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not appear to be backwards-compatible (i.e., 10.3.2 you can only use VALUES, 10.3.3 you can only use VALUE). It seems a bit hostile to introduce breaking, backwards-incompatible SQL changes in a point release (not even a minor version!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will consider an alternative, such as supporting VALUES until 11.x?&lt;/p&gt;

We're trying to do that whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, &lt;code&gt;VALUES()&lt;/code&gt; is the syntax from SQL Standard. For more than 20 years, as far as I know. And &lt;code&gt;VALUES()&lt;/code&gt; function was added to MySQL about 15 years ago. Either way compatibility with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; had to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we thought that future-wise it's more important to be compatible with the SQL Standard (and numerous other databases).&lt;/p&gt;
