&lt;p&gt;Whatever order the rows were updated in on the master, the row events will contain row updates in the same order, and matching before/after images. And applying the row updates one by one in order on the slave will result in the same data as on the master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It though a very interesting/wierd case as you wrote, I wasn't aware that this kind of query was even possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Answer probably too old to be useful to the author, just adding it for reference.)&lt;/p&gt;
