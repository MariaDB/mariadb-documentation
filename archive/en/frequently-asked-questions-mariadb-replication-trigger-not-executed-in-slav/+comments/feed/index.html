If master table does not contain any triggers then the slave-only triggers work just fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I could not get the meaning.
Do you mean that when you tried creating a trigger on the slave this sort of error
happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="anchored_heading" id="error-1235-42000-this-version-of-mariadb-doesnt-yet-support-multiple-triggers-with-the-same-action-time-and-event-for-one-table"&gt;ERROR 1235 (42000): This version of MariaDB doesn't yet support 'multiple triggers with the same action time and event for one table'&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to enable on slave only some of the triggers, like in your use case those that are only define for the slave side, the answer is NO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to suggest a feature request on Jira and also describe in details suspiciously looking &lt;em&gt;'None of the slave triggers get executed unless I drop the original delete trigger in master'&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your questions!&lt;/p&gt;
