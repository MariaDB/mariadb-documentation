At this point in time we don't support the collations that allow case insensitive matching. &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-495"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-495&lt;/a&gt; tracks an enhancement request to allow case insensitive matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only solution for now is to store another column where you convert the text to lower case (or upper case) and then match on that with a lower case value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a solution I would love to hear about it&lt;/p&gt;

I also tried to change the parameter in my.conf - but that didn't work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did try in regular MariaDB and it works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of the DDL that worked in regular bot not in ColumnStore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      partner VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with what I have seen in MariaDB ColumnStore but if we cannot search values as case insentive, we will not be able to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else run into this problem with ColumnStore and figured out a way around it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, you can set that for your default collation for all columns, if that's your predominant need. I think it's "collation-server" in /etc/my.cnf. You could then make individual columns case sensitive as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't use ColumnStore, but that's how you'd do case-insensitive searching on regular MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
