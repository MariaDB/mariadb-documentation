Have you tried setting innodb to use multiple threads? I work for &lt;a href="https://semtix.cz/"&gt;https://semtix.cz/&lt;/a&gt; and we are managing a 3TB table for a client - this would not work without fine-tuning things related to storage engine... Indexes are one thing, fast storage is the second (and more important).&lt;/p&gt;

It keeps the table in tact and updates a new one, while using triggers to ensure the new one is up to date.  I would always recommend trying this on a non-production server first, but i used this consistently and successfully for years.&lt;/p&gt;
