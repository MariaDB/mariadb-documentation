So an empty MEMORY table does nearly not use any space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: 2 MEMORY tables with max_heap_table_size = 64M and fully filled up until: ERROR 1114 (HY000): The table 'test_mem2' is full&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;select event_name, CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED 
  from performance_schema.memory_summary_global_by_event_name 
  where event_name like 'memory/memory/%';
+-------------------------+------------------------------+
| event_name              | CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED |
+-------------------------+------------------------------+
| memory/memory/HP_SHARE  |                         4776 |
| memory/memory/HP_INFO   |                         4000 |
| memory/memory/HP_PTRS   |                    134636384 |
| memory/memory/HP_KEYDEF |                            0 |

I have 200G data,i wonder if i can save them in one memory table.&lt;/p&gt;

We have cases where it is better to insert data into a Memory table, do some fast processing and then store the data on disk into a MyISAM/Aria table. Obviously, I have tried approaches where we do this on a row by row basis:
create Database; 
create table `myisam` (...) ENGINE=MyISAM;
for loop:
  For every row of inmemory table insert row in myisam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc,etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I am looking on something that might be a bit more efficient (speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

I could'nt find in the documentation the column count limits for memory engines.
What is the maximum column count in memory engines on &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/"&gt;MariaDB 10.1&lt;/a&gt;? Same as in MySql?
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br&gt;

At the Moment my rather small tables need a lot of RAM when I convert them from MyISAM to MEMORY Storage Engine...&lt;/p&gt;

But it would be cool, yes&lt;/p&gt;

I recall there only being table level locking on the memory engine in MySQL, which was one of the biggest performance issues I ran into when evaluating it as a pure memory db solution for my use case.  I recall Timesten having a row level locking pure memory table solution which worked extremely well.  It would be really cool to see something like this in an open source db solution that is as mature and feature rich as MySQL. &lt;/p&gt;
