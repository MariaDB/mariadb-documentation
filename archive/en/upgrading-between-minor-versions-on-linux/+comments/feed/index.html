Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.
3. Install the new version of MariaDB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a problem here, since cmake is braindead, there is no make uninstall, unlike with autotools thats been a feature for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means all the hassle of d/ling old version, spending 50 mins biulding it, installing over existing, then using a horribly botched way pof shell redirect from a manifest file to remove it, before make installking the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remind me again WHY you opted to move to this cmake garbage...&lt;/p&gt;
