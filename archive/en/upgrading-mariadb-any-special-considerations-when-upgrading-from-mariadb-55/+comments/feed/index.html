&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/"&gt;MariaDB 10.0&lt;/a&gt; is still Alpha quality, and not all features planned for 10.0 final have been pushed yet, so you'll want to tread carefully and have a plan for reversing the upgrade, should things break horribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I haven't had any trouble running &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/"&gt;MariaDB 10.0&lt;/a&gt; on my test box. Even so, I don't have it running in production anywhere yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
