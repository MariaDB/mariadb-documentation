For example, if the database servers have 8 cores with 16GB of RAM, a MaxScale server should have 4 cores and 8GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a starting point and you'll need to estimate how much resources you need. The actual amount of resources needed depends on the modules you use and the traffic that goes through MaxScale. If you use modules like the cache filter, you'll benefit from having more RAM on the MaxScale server compared to a configuration where you don't use it.&lt;/p&gt;
