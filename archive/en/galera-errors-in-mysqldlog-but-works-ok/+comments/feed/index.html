&lt;p&gt;2) If you are getting crashing errors, please &lt;a href="/kb/en/reporting-bugs/"&gt;report as a bug&lt;/a&gt;, as those shouldn't be happening.&lt;/p&gt;

I copied the example notify script and changed the user, password, and host parameters to ensure a valid connection. I chose not to use root as the notify account.  I modified the wsrep_notify_cmd to point to the new script and bounced each node.  The notify function was executed and the error messages ceased.  This was my primary goal and was addressed by the information you provided.  I have a couple of follow-up items and can create additional entries if recommended.
1. As I created the user and changed the password, I noticed that the new password worked on only one node. I found this article indicating that I need to use DDL to change the password: &lt;a href="http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/userchanges.html"&gt;http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/userchanges.html&lt;/a&gt;.  I thought that since I was using the "SET PASSWORD" command, I was using DDL.  I had to execute this on each node in order to have the same password on each node.
2. Looking at the sample notify script, it appear that it drops and creates the schema every time. We had some node crashes due to a validation script that was dropping/creating tables on multiple nodes a the same time.  It caused two nodes to crash.  I know this is just a sample and I would be free to change it. I'm just wondering if I understand correctly and whether anyone has reported problems with this.&lt;/p&gt;

Looks like your wsrep_notify script is not executable by that user. Please refer to: &lt;a href="http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/notificationcmd.html"&gt;http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/notificationcmd.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
