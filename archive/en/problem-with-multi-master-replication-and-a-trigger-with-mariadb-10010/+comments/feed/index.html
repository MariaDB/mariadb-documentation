If the problem you are trying to solve is urgent, you might need to look for a different approach. If you prefer to wait, the first Alpha release of 10.1 is expected to be out later in a few months. However, please be aware that it is very unlikely to reach GA quality this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem, so you mean this trigger version is not support in 10.0.10 and it is not my mistake.
Now I must wait for the 10.1 version in xx.2014?&lt;/p&gt;

It should appear in the next major release, 10.1. Sorry for the inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;
