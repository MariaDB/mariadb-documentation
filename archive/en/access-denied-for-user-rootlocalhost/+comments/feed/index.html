Enabling https in my Apache config solved the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

In MariaDB, the &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; address is actually referring to the local UNIX domain socket (usually at &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock&lt;/code&gt;) that the server listens on and is separate from the address defined by bind_address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, creating a completely new user guarantees that no default configurations are in use. Modifying the &lt;code&gt;mysql.user&lt;/code&gt; table shouldn't be done as it might not actually reflect what the server actually holds in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
