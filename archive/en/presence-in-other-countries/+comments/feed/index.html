Pl explain the role of Community ambasidor.
Definitely I cannot be technology and strategic partner. Till I become expert in MariaDB/MySQL I cannot be support, professional services and consulting partner.
I would like to be Community ambassador. My mission will be:
1)	We are empowered to create a better world together.
2)	Together we co-create our existence.
3)	Together we make Mariadb project a success. 
I am looking for long and fruitful association with MariaDB.
1)	To get expertise in MariaDB technical, functional and culture.
2)	Propagate MariaDB initially in reputed engineering and post degree collages, research organization and technology savvy organizations.
3)	Form a small team to work on Mariadb projects.
4)	Provide help to support, upgrade Mariadb database.
5)	Encourage people to develop applications on MariaDB.
6)	To be a part of MariaDB development team to resolve issues, bugs and new enhancements/releases.
7)	Contact people/organizations who want to donate for open source community.
8)	Put forward my ideas before community for approval and further develop those ideas.   &lt;/p&gt;
