&lt;p&gt;With your program you are linking look at ldd programname and readelf -a  programname and check it has the same version expectations as the SONAME in the mariadb client library. If its the same version a ltrace to determine which call its failing on would be good to know. The compliance is meant to be the same &lt;a href="/kb/en/about-the-mariadb-client-library-for-c/"&gt;about-the-mariadb-client-library-for-c&lt;/a&gt; so please report any problems &lt;a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/CONC"&gt;https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/CONC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now I change to 20GByte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, how to start mariadb?  
I  could install mysql without problems with apt-get, so now want to find out how to put Mariadb 10 on top of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to this, I can link my program to the Maria-C 2.0, but that crashes immediately at start. Maybe that is not compliant with Mysql anymore...?&lt;/p&gt;
