&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we are going to retrieve the 10 colors when selecting the SKU. May i know that if we are using the JSON array as the column type, the data we still able to use the SQL command to retrieve? Because now we are going to use the SQL for retrieve &amp;amp; manage data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you show me show example on how to use the JSON array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks You.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL doesn't usually use data in arrays. The paradigm is normally a separate table with a common primary key. If you are going to need to search for SKU by color this aspect of normalisation is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are just going to retrieve the 10 colors when selecting the SKU, you could put the 10 colors into a JSON array and have that as the column type.&lt;/p&gt;
