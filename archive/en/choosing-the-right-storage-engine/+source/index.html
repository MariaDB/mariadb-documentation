        <textarea id="answer_source" class="creole_source autogrow">&lt;&lt;toc&gt;&gt;
A high-level overview of the main reasons for choosing a particular storage engine:
== Topic List

===General Purpose
*[[InnoDB]] is a good general transaction storage engine, and, from MariaDB 10.2, the best choice in most cases. It is the default storage engine from MariaDB 10.2. For earlier releases, XtraDB was a performance enhanced fork of InnoDB and is usually preferred.
* [[aria|Aria]], MariaDB&#39;s more modern improvement on [[myisam|MyISAM]], has a small footprint and allows for easy copying between systems.
* [[myisam|MyISAM]] has a small footprint and allows for easy copying between systems. MyISAM is MySQL&#39;s oldest storage engine. There is usually little reason to use it except for legacy purposes. Aria is MariaDB&#39;s more modern improvement.
* [[xtradb|XtraDB]] was the best choice in MariaDB 10.1 and earlier in the majority of cases. It was a performance-enhanced fork of InnoDB and was MariaDB&#39;s default engine until MariaDB 10.1.

===Scaling, Partitioning
When you want to split your database load on several servers or optimize for scaling. We also suggest looking at [[Galera]], a synchronous multi-master cluster.
 
*[[spider|Spider]] uses partitioning to provide data sharding through multiple servers.
* [[columnstore|ColumnStore]] utilizes a massively parallel distributed data architecture and is designed for big data scaling to process petabytes of data. 
*The [[merge|MERGE]] storage engine is a collection of identical [[myisam|MyISAM]] tables that can be used as one. &#34;Identical&#34; means that all tables have identical column and index information.
*[[tokudb|TokuDB]] is a transactional storage engine which is optimized for workloads that do not fit in memory, and provides a good compression ratio. TokuDB has been deprecated by its upstream developers, and is disabled in MariaDB 10.5, and removed in MariaDB 10.6

===Compression / Archive
*[[myrocks|MyRocks]] enables greater compression than InnoDB, as well as less  write amplification giving better endurance of flash storage and improving overall throughput.
*The [[archive|Archive]] storage engine is, unsurprisingly, best used for archiving.
*[[tokudb|TokuDB]] is a transactional storage engine which is optimized for workloads that do not fit in memory, and provides a good compression ratio. TokuDB has been deprecated by its upstream developers, and is disabled in MariaDB 10.5, and removed in MariaDB 10.6

===Connecting to Other Data Sources
When you want to use data not stored in a MariaDB database. 

*[[connect|CONNECT]] allows access to different kinds of text files and remote resources as if they were regular MariaDB tables.
*The [[csv|CSV]] storage engine can read and append to files stored in CSV (comma-separated-values) format. However, since MariaDB 10.0, CONNECT is a better choice and is more flexibly able to read and write such files.
*[[federatedx|FederatedX]] uses libmysql to talk to the data source, the data source being a remote RDBMS. Currently, since FederatedX only uses libmysql, it can only talk to another MySQL RDBMS.
*[[CassandraSE|CassandraSE]] is a storage engine allowing access to an older version of Apache Cassandra NoSQL DBMS. It was relatively experimental, is no longer being actively developed and has been removed in MariaDB 10.6.

===Search Optimized
Search engines optimized for search. 

*[[sphinxse|SphinxSE]] is used as a proxy to run statements on a remote Sphinx database server (mainly useful for advanced fulltext searches).
*[[mroonga|Mroonga]] provides fast CJK-ready full text searching using column store.

===Cache, Read-only
*[[memory-storage-engine|MEMORY]] does not write data on-disk (all rows are lost on crash) and is best-used for read-only caches of data from other tables, or for temporary work areas. With the default [[innodb|InnoDB]] and other storage engines having good caching, there is less need for this engine than in the past.

===Other Specialized Storage Engines
* [[s3-storage-engine|S3 Storage Engine]] is a read-only storage engine that stores its data in Amazon S3.
* [[sequence|Sequence]] allows the creation of ascending or descending sequences of numbers (positive integers) with a given starting value, ending value and increment, creating virtual, ephemeral tables automatically when you need them. 
*The [[blackhole|BLACKHOLE]] storage engine accepts data but does not store it and always returns an empty result. This can be useful in [[replication]] environments, for example, if you want to run complex filtering rules on a slave without incurring any overhead on a master.
*[[oqgraph|OQGRAPH]] allows you to handle hierarchies (tree structures) and complex graphs (nodes having many connections in several directions).

== Alphabetical List
*The [[Archive]] storage engine is, unsurprisingly, best used for archiving.
*[[Aria]], MariaDB&#39;s more modern improvement on MyISAM, has a small footprint and allows for easy copy between systems.
*The [[blackhole|BLACKHOLE]] storage engine accepts data but does not store it and always returns an empty result. This can be useful in [[replication]] environments, for example, if you want to run complex filtering rules on a slave without incurring any overhead on a master.
