The MySQL monitor expects that a master will always have at least one slave before it assigns master status to the server. With a two node master-slave pair, when the master dies and the slave is promoted, MaxScale cannot be absolutely certain that the slave is actually the new master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time this problem is solved by using the &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise/5947/"&gt;multi-master monitor&lt;/a&gt; instead of the MySQL monitor and placing the slave server into read-only mode. With this, a failover can be performed by putting the master into read-only mode and removing the read-only mode from the slave. MaxScale will see this change and start sending writes to the new master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replication-manager is the recommended way to do failovers with MariaDB 10. It will automatically set the slave servers into read-only mode and also adjust it when a failover is performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming 2.1 version of MaxScale, there's a simple failover mode for the MySQL monitor which should make these kinds of situations easier to handle without external programs. You can read about the upcoming failover mode &lt;a href="https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/blob/develop/Documentation/Monitors/MySQL-Monitor.md#failover"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The databases are MySQL databases and I used mysqlrpladmin for the failover (it's in mysql-utilities package). But what is the internal/native way to do this with Maxscale? The replication-manager?&lt;/p&gt;

Is this done by some external program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend looking at the &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise/5947/"&gt;Multi-Master Monitor&lt;/a&gt; if the slave always has read_only set to ON and some external actor removes it from the master.&lt;/p&gt;
