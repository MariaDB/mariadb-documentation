&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;Your database may be corrupt or you may have copied the InnoDB tablespace but not the InnoDB log files. Please refer to https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/innodb-recovery-modes/ for information about forcing recovery
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it appears there's some corruption. You haven't given any information about how this situation may have arisen, but follow the &lt;a href="/kb/en/innodb-recovery-modes/"&gt;suggested link&lt;/a&gt; for details on forcing recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
