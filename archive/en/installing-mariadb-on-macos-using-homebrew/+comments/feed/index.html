If you don't know the default root password, you can get passwordless root login with "sudo mysql".  This will log you in similar to --skip-grant-tables. Then you can set the root password. This command should be in the guide which is thin and flimsy and doesn't really provide any support.&lt;/p&gt;

When building from source on an older Mac OS version 10.1.36 (the current 10.1 version for Homebrew) builds fine, but the 10.2 and 10.3 formulae fail with a ranlib-related error.&lt;/p&gt;

I had to install boost and judy (currently in the boneyard). The issues with building OQGRAPH on macOS with llvm were fixed only recently and those changes are not included in &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-1022-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.2.2&lt;/a&gt;, but they are included in &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-10119-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 10.1.19&lt;/a&gt;, so if you force Homebrew to build from source, you should get the result you're looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;brew install boost homebrew/boneyard/judy
brew install mariadb --build-from-source
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix for building OQGRAPH should be included in the next release of 10.2, so please try --devel again when 10.2.3 is available if you want to play with 10.2 features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try those steps and encounter problems, please provide some additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homebrew installation lacks the CONNECT and OQGRAPH engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I REALLY need hierarchical queries! I can't install 10.2.2, and I apparently can't use storage engines that support hierarchical queries!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions? Any projections on when 10.2 will be "bottled" as a homebrew binary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
