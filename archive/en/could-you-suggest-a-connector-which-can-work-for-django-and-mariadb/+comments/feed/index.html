&lt;p&gt;1. Re-install MariaDB to solve the problem that can't install the package "libmariadbclient-dev". "libmariadbclient-dev" is prerequisite for mysqlclient package.
2. PyMySQL can work well in the "fractional seconds" function with MySQL, not MariaDB.
3. I use mysqlclient in place of PyMySQL. Because mysqlclient can work well with MariaDB, and I think it is easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for all your help, Bryan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running MariaDB on the same machine you will need to install mariadb-server, otherwise you do not need it.&lt;/p&gt;

Then I followed your steps. It works. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the installation in your web site before.
Could you tell me that why it doesn't have "sudo apt-get install mariadb-server" in your steps? Your web site has the installation step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I had removed the mariadb-server. I wonder why it can still work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you added our &lt;a href="https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/#mirror=jmu&amp;amp;distro=Ubuntu&amp;amp;distro_release=wily--ubuntu_wily&amp;amp;version=10.0"&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt; to your system? With those added I was able to install libmariadbclient-dev with no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xcbcb082a1bb943db
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386] http://mirror.jmu.edu/pub/mariadb/repo/10.0/ubuntu wily main'

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev

sudo apt-get install python-pip build-essential python-dev libssl-dev

# you only need to install one of these, not both. However they both worked for me
sudo pip install MySQL-python 
sudo pip install mysqlclient
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I am not running on python 3 or Django 1.9 so I can't confirm that microseconds work with those but according to the documentation they do. If they do not, please provide the exact error you are getting and I will try to help.&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry, Maybe I expressed a wrong meaning. I wanted to know whick DB API Drivers(like &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/ja/1.9/ref/databases/#mysql-db-api-drivers"&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/ja/1.9/ref/databases/#mysql-db-api-drivers&lt;/a&gt;) can work good for MariaDB.
.
I have visited the web site you suggested. I can't install the package "libmariadbclient-dev" for the Ubuntu 15.10. I checked the package in "Ubuntu Packages Search". The package is only for Ubuntu 14.04. I don't know why the new version Ubuntu doesn't have the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I have to tell you the whole story why I need to find another DB API Drivers for MariaDB.
First thought, I need DATETIME type column can store fractional seconds in Database. I think MariaDB 10 supports it. But I don't know why I can't implement it. Then I tried to use the sqlite which builds in Django as database. It works.
I use PyMySQL as DB API Driver for MariaDB now. So I though PyMySQL maybe have a bug.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my friend can implement it using MySQL. His work environment is Python 3.5.1+, Django 1.9.5, PyMySQL 0.7.4, ubuntu 16.04. It is almost like mine, although the versions are sort of different. The only difference is that he doesn't use MariaDB as database. So I confuse which node is wrong. Could you give me some suggestions how to clarify the question? Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The django MySQL connector (&lt;code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"&gt;django.db.backends.mysql&lt;/code&gt;) works great with MariaDB. That is what we use for our Django / MariaDB projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guide I found for slightly older versions of Django and ubuntu (but still should work) is here: &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-mysql-or-mariadb-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04"&gt;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-mysql-or-mariadb-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
