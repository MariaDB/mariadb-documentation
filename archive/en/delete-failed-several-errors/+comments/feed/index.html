&lt;p&gt;You may be hitting a number of issues. You could also file a jira with the output of columnstoreSupport and we can review for issues if you are still reproducing these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what you are doing you should look into partition based drops since you appear to have time based data: &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/columnstore-partition-management/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/columnstore-partition-management/&lt;/a&gt; That is the best way to do large scale deletes and will reclaim disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
