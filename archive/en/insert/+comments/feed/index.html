Users start out with questions like "how can I copy stuff from one database to another?" and "can I do a join between tables in different databases?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added the coment on the need for this documentation after seeing a comment elewhere that while they had found info on the likes of stackexchange, the poster hadn't been able to find a definitive statement that such things were possible in the mysql docs.&lt;/p&gt;

So, wouldn't it be better to add a specific page about how to qualify a name?&lt;/p&gt;
