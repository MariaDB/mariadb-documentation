It is error prone and unsafe.  Instead use prepared statements.  This looks to be PHP so you should do something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;$pdo = new \PDO($connection_string)
$query = &amp;#34;UPDATE users SET username = ?, password = ? WHERE id = ?&amp;#34;;
$stmt = $pdo-&amp;gt;prepare($query);
$stmt-&amp;gt;execute(array($username, $password, $id));
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code is safe from injections and easily shows the query.  When you did it your way, you added an extra comma which was not as easily seen.&lt;/p&gt;
