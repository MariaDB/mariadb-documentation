Writes should still only happen on one node at a time to prevent conflicts on commit. Using something like &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/maxscale/"&gt;MaxScale&lt;/a&gt; can make this easier as it automatically spreads the read workload to all nodes while still focusing writes to a single node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution for write scaling would be something like &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/products/enterprise/xpand/"&gt;MariaDB Xpand&lt;/a&gt; that is designed for parallel writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Galera Cluster we need to configure all nodes on same Operating system. If the One node is on windows platform that can also be connect with Cluster environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't consider doing classical replication between 4 nodes. If something goes wrong it will be complicated recovery process with some risks in getting the recovery steps incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
