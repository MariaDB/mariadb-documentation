In Functional Dependency X Determines Y. But The Condition For BCNF Is That Y Should Be A Subset Of X i.e. Trivial Functional Dependency Is A Prerequisite. Course Can't Be Subset Of Instructor As Each Course Can Have One Or More Instructors. Moreover, Each Instructor Takes Only One Course Which Seems True For Functional Dependency But Not For Trivial Functional Dependency. If The Situation Is Reversed Such That Each Instructor Can Teach One Or More Courses And Each Course Has Only Instructor. Then Course Becomes X And Determines Y i.e. Instructor, Even Then Y Never Becomes Subset Of X. Instead X Becomes Subset Of Y In Both Cases, Situation Reversed Or Not.&lt;/p&gt;
