I.e you can start an instance, which is private to your application, and it does not need to be per-machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can agree to extent, it can (just slightly) complicate the logic of the GUI app, as it would need to incorporate the startup and shutdown. But as for installation, as compared to current, libmariadb.dll, and mysqld.exe are needed, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

Normal DB server would greatly complicate installation of app.&lt;/p&gt;

I think not providing what we do not test is right thing to do. We did not hear many complaints. But can you tell why do you need this as opposed to normal client and normal server.&lt;/p&gt;

Are we supposed to build it ourselves?
Maybe it's better to provide that download separately?&lt;/p&gt;
