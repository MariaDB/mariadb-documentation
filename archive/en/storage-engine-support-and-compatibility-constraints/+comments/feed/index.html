In the source code, plugin APIs are &lt;a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/server/tree/10.1/include/mysql"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Although I don't see how you can check the compatibility manually.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can reasonably expect that any UDF or a plugin present in a specific MariaDB version will not disappear if you upgrade to the next minor version. And it is unlikely to disappear if you upgrade to the next major version. We treat backward compatibility rather seriously and don't remove features lightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-You said "There is a certain API that plugins should use": could you give a link where those APIs are listed for a given plugin please (engines , UDFs..) this in order to check the compatibility manually if necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In instance, If we developp a process under MariaDb  server 10.1 using stored proc+functions, tables from different supported engines (say CONNECT, SPIDER...),UDFs...and then MariaDb is upgraded to a newest version which doesn't support CONNECT or a specific UDF so I have to change those plugins and implement it another way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
