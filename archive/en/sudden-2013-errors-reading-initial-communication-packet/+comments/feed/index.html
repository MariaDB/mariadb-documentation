If I nc the DB server I get the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nc [IP] 3306&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host '[IP]' is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB Server. So it appears its actually a permissions issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding for others that may have same problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for brevity. Unsure what exact details would assist; so, was really hoping for common areas to troubleshoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I modified db permissions to temporarily grant usage permissions from any host from a specific user 
(grant all privileges on [db] to 'user'@'*' identified by 'pass';) and still receive the same error. This leads me to believe it isn't a permissions issue right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When monitoring traffic at the DB using tcpdump, I can see the client and server establish a connection and push some traffic; however, receive the above error. This is a remotely accessible database (not bound to localhost)&lt;/p&gt;
