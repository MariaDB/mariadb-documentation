I realized that if my query looks like this:
 SELECT *
 FROM TABLE2
 WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 10009
 it works, but it is not optimized when the BETWEEN is in a JOIN or SUBQUERY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried to create a function that seems to me to be the best system:
CREATE FUNCTION CP2 (iNum1 INT, iNum2 INT)
RETURNS bigint (20)
LANGUAGE SQL
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
  RETURN iNum1 * 10000 + iNum2;
END
but even so the BETWEEN is not optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for the attention you will want to give me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks for the answer, but I think the problem is in the fact that if the BETWEEN is between 2 absolute values ​​the optimization works, instead if the 2 values ​​are calculations it does not.
And this on a lot of rows is a big slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mariadb_10.6&amp;amp;fiddle=a6e5a43adc4df54ed55493aba947f526"&gt;https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mariadb_10.6&amp;amp;fiddle=a6e5a43adc4df54ed55493aba947f526&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think your sample data is big enough (and I probably don't know enough about optimizer strategies to answer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bigger sample fiddle, maybe the folks on &lt;a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/"&gt;https://dba.stackexchange.com/&lt;/a&gt; can give a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;
