&lt;p&gt;The signal is the only other shutdown mechanism so its just unknown -&amp;gt; signal.
Maybe this could be modified to log the process id and user (from sigwaitinfo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another program or service to issue a signal to the MariaDB process it would need to be a root user, or the mysql user, or a user that has capability CAP_KILL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently look at systemctl status mariadb.service. Maybe something in systemd-analyze dump.&lt;/p&gt;

This is normally done with a killall mysqld or kill $(pidof mysqld).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running under systemd the TErm signal approach is also the default used in a systemctl stop mariadb.service.&lt;/p&gt;
