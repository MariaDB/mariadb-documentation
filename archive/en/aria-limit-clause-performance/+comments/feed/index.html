The reason is that as rows are not ordered, there is no way to start from a certain row other than reading through all the old rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better way to do this is to select rows ordered by a key field and the next query from where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;SELECT * from t1 where key &amp;gt;= '' ORDER BY key LIMIT 1000
SELECT * from t1 where key &amp;gt; 'last-fetched-value' ORDER BY key LIMIT 1000
