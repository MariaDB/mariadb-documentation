But I was trying to install with repositories becuz I am a just begining engineer and I don't know how to install "tar.gz" file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could you let me know the way to install It with "mariadb-10.6.18-linux-systemd-x86_64.tar.gz" in details?&lt;/p&gt;

I don't believe a network connection is needed to install MariaDB, but of course it is to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the instructions for installing binary tarballs are on &lt;a href="/kb/en/installing-mariadb-binary-tarballs/"&gt;Installing MariaDB Binary Tarballs&lt;/a&gt;. If you're having problems, let us know specific details in a followup.&lt;/p&gt;
