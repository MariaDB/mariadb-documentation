Connector/NET sounds like a better alternative to me - at least i know there is a mysql.data.cf.dll distributed inside ZIP package on Windows, and  that this was compiled for compact framework, and this dll is officially supported.&lt;/p&gt;

But the Connector/NET may be a different solution I implement with Mono. I didn't think about it because I don't know anything about Mono. It may be time to try it!
Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
