&lt;p&gt;install soname 'ha_tokudb';&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Connect the solution i found was quite simple: just run the command: apt-get install libodbc1
After that, the command install soname 'ha_connect'; is working and Connect engine is installed.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to use TokuDB, you need the second one, it has ha_tokudb.so. It is expected to work on Ubuntu 12.04, at least it is installable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Connect engine, as the previous comment says, you are missing the library. It is possible that it doesn't exist for Ubuntu 12.04 (binary tarballs are not fully compatible with all systems). If you need the Connect engine, try to install the deb packages; there will be a separate deb package  mariadb-connect-engine-10.0 in addition to the usual server/client packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as the previous comment also said, the deb packages for Precise do not have TokuDB engine. If you need both TokuDB and Connect at once, you can install deb packages and copy ha_tokudb.so from the binary tarball into the plugin folder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the cmake version is too low and possibly the gcc version is as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the CONNECT issue, you are missing the libodbc.  Similar to  &lt;a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-5653"&gt;https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-5653&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
