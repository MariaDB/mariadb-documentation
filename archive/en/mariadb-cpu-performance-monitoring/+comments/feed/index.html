&lt;p&gt;As to how to go about it, I found that what works best for me is &lt;a href="https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-monitor"&gt;Navicat Monitor&lt;/a&gt;.  It's an agent-less database server instance monitoring tool for MySQL and MariaDB. Version 2 adds support for SQL Server as well. It can monitor database process and system resources for locally hosted database instances as well as those provided via cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows Type servers, you can configure CPU &amp;amp; Memories section of the Instance Configuration Dialog to monitor O/S metrics over Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  That will cause server metrics like CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage to appear in Dashboard Instance Cards.  From there, you can click on the system metrics to see more details, including Swap Usage, Connections, and Network Throughput. Each metric includes an interactive chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give that a try!&lt;/p&gt;

Also include SHOW GLOBAL STATUS; SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES; SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;  from at least 24 hrs of uptime. Include current my.cnf settings as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU stats themselves don't often lead to something that can be directly enacted upon.&lt;/p&gt;
