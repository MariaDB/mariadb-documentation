It's not owning or selling MariaDB.
Just because an US company participates in an open source project, doesn't mean that it's affected by US trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All technology used in MariaDB is open source and there is no unique encryption or other technology in MariaDB that is under any US trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All MariaDB code is available for anyone at github, but this is the case for a lot of open source projects, including Linux.
To summarize, if they can use Linux in Iran, then they can also use MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
