&lt;p&gt;Yes, the lack of indexes (but for the implicit on _id) is a very known weakness. However, without support for &lt;em&gt;indexes on expressions&lt;/em&gt;, it would be quite complex to implemenent. &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6017"&gt;MDEV-6017&lt;/a&gt; adds basic support for indexes on expressions to MariaDB Server 11.8 and the plan is to support the indexing of fields in MaxScale 25.08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are particular commands that you find essential, please create a feature request. There is obviously a lot of territory to cover, so feedback that helps in deciding the direction to take is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if a document database is the only thing you want, then NoSQL Protocol may not be the right choice for you. But, if you primarily use regular SQL and in addition have some needs for a document database, then it might be, as you in that case will manage with just one backend setup. With the added benefit of being able to access the document data also from the SQL side. Provided, of course, that the current limitations in the functionality are not showstoppers for you. Everyone does not need e.g. geospatial queries.&lt;/p&gt;
