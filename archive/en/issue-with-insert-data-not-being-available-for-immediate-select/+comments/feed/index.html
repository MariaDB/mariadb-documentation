I have two functions -- one that INSERTs data into table A, and the other that INSERT/SELECTs the data into table B.  Except for the difference in SQL statements being executed and the exact parameters being bound to each one, the two functions are identical.  The insert into table A works, the INSERT/SELECT into table B doesn't.  That's why I'm really leaning towards "there's something about MariaDB going on that I don't understand" -- like the write from my INSERT is being delayed such that the data isn't there when it comes time to do the INSERT/SELECT.&lt;/p&gt;
