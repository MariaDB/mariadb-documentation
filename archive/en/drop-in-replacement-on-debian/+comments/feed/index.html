&lt;p&gt;    &lt;a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-3882"&gt;https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-3882&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic problem is that there are two versions of package libmysqlclient18,
the standard Debian package and the package from the MariaDB repo. And apt-get
considers the standard Debian package as having the higher version and prefers
to install that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one work-around is to explicitly request the MariaDB version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    apt-get install mariadb-server-5.5 libmysqlclient18=5.5.28-mariadb1wheezy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: It used to be that this was not an issue, as Debian and Ubuntu
normally do not put newer upstream versions into released distro
versions. Thus the MariaDB version would always be newer, and this problem
does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Oracle has implemented its own ideas of security fix policies for MySQL,
which means that details of security patches are kept proprietary. This makes
it impossible for distros to backport security fixes, so they have to instead
put new upstream releases into stable distro versions. As a side effect, the
MariaDB versions can now lag behind the standard distro versions.&lt;/p&gt;

If so there might not be much the MariaDB developers can do, even so I would recommend filing a bug report at &lt;a href="http://mariadb.org/jira"&gt;http://mariadb.org/jira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to also contact the puppet-dashboard developers and ask them about supporting MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
