Now that all makes sense. I have been using Oracle for school, but I am now using MariaDB at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two RDBMS have enough differences to be frustrating when migrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

The default delimiter is semicolon. So, in your initial example, the client sends everything from &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; and up and including &lt;code&gt;SET NEW.ClGender ='U'&lt;/code&gt;, which of course does not make a complete valid query. This is what the server complains about in the error message -- it finds emptiness where it expects &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change the delimiter and use it at the end of the trigger definition, the client understands that the whole definition should be sent as a whole, and the server is able to interpret it correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly fine to use non-default delimiters when you define stored procedures (including triggers); you don't need to invent tricks to avoid it. It is not always possible anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are curious, in your case you could phrase it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
CREATE TRIGGER trig_client_gndr 
BEFORE INSERT ON WM_CLIENT 
FOR EACH ROW 
SET NEW.ClGender = IF(NEW.ClGender NOT IN ('M','F'),'U',NEW.ClGender);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it should have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That worked perfectly. Can you be so kind as to explain why it worked, and how I would write that statement without semicolons? I tried to write it without any semicolons and it gave me an error at the END IF line. Of course I removed the Delimiter statements on that attempt also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again&lt;/p&gt;

Something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
DELIMITER | 
CREATE TRIGGER trig_client_gndr 
BEFORE INSERT ON WM_CLIENT 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
	IF UPPER(NEW.ClGender) NOT IN ('M','F') THEN 
		SET NEW.ClGender ='U'; 
	END IF; 
END |
DELIMITER ;
&lt;/pre&gt;
