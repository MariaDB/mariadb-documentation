We cant seem to fin where th error log for this would be, do you have a general access route Ia can try to find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade to &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-103/"&gt;MariaDB 10.3&lt;/a&gt; was done through WHM using root user access. Also, checking on the upgrade option in WHM, we found this Critical message: In MariaDBÂ® 10.3, the mysqldump client includes logic for the mysql.transaction_registry table. You cannot use the mysqldump client from an earlier MariaDB release on &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-103/"&gt;MariaDB 10.3&lt;/a&gt; and later. For more information about how to upgrade to &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-103/"&gt;MariaDB 10.3&lt;/a&gt;, read the MariaDB upgrade documentation .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont know if this has anything to do with the error we get when trying to access routines.&lt;/p&gt;

There answer will be there derived from the SQL that phpMyAdmin issues to MariaDB. Can you provide this either directly or with assistance from your hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you know the way MySQL-5.6 was upgrade to MariaDB-10.3 that would be appreciated. Was mysql-upgrade run after the upgrade?&lt;/p&gt;
