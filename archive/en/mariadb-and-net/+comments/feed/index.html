&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a [pretty good tutorial](&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/connect-csharp"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/connect-csharp&lt;/a&gt;) too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers! &lt;/p&gt;

It's GPL and not LGPL which seem to mean you in some situation have to pay a huge fee of â‚¬250+ per seat!
I don't have knowledge about GPL and LGPL myself, just got this from a rather old thread on pcreview (&lt;a href="https://www.pcreview.co.uk/threads/anyone-use-devarts-mydirect-net-and-or-dbforgefusion-for-mysql.3619468/"&gt;https://www.pcreview.co.uk/threads/anyone-use-devarts-mydirect-net-and-or-dbforgefusion-for-mysql.3619468/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But MySQL .Net connector is still GPL licensed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another reason for MariaDB to have there own .Net connector. But I guess there might be some issues just coping 99,9% of the code with his new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative is the commercial connector from DevArt: dotConnect for MySQL
(&lt;a href="https://www.devart.com/dotconnect/mysql/"&gt;https://www.devart.com/dotconnect/mysql/&lt;/a&gt;)
Haven't tried it myself yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why do you have your own versions of those connectors when MySQL also have equivalent connector for those languages/technologies? MariaDB users can just use those connectors, right?
Of course not! It's obvious why!
And the same arguments can be use to why you should have your own .Net connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume the the correct answer to the original question is "it's a matter of priorities.".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I think you make a mistake not prioritizing a .Net connector.
At least just reuse 99,9% of the MySQL .Net connector code.
It's a bad signal to send: "Use the MySQL .Net connector"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that your cannot make a connector to all languages.....but I would say .Net should not be neglected. But I have no statistic it back it up. It would be interesting to know how many uses (or would like to use) .Net against MySQL/MariaDB. If it's me, Danny and a few others, I understand your prioritize...but I wonder :-P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't do any Connector development unfortunately. We only focus on the server, hence MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a time comes and we need to handle connector development, we will do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I hope you do not mine installing the connector despite disliking the controlling company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTH&lt;/p&gt;
