&lt;p&gt;Intel/Xeons are ruling the desktop and server scene with regards to performance. With each generation of Intel cpus, they are moving further ahead. Sandy Bridge and Sandy Bridge-E based Intel processors are up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So would be great to have CentOS/RHEL RPM packages which are further optimised for Intel cpus.&lt;/p&gt;
