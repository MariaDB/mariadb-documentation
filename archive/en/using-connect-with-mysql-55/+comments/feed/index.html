However, as MySQL (and &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5&lt;/a&gt;) were missing the discovery features, having column description automatically made when creating some table types required a small modification into the source code.
Also for MySQL, because engines specific create options do not exist, all options specific to CONNECT had to be placed in comment fields.
However, since migrating to &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/"&gt;MariaDB 10.0&lt;/a&gt;, the new version of CONNECT is no more compatible with MySQL and the old
version is largely outdated and buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
