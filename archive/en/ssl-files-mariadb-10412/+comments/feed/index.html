As as long as the wifle are readable by the server's `mysql` user. it shoudl be ok. Your directories are ok as they won't be read as configuration files. Recommend etc-keeper for preserving etc against accidential packaging faults however I see no immediate problem with your configation. It will require a restart to take effect. Using `\s` in the mysql client can show if a TLS connection made over TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
