If you are running a single server deployment, you should look at increasing the TotalUmMemory setting and decreasing NumBlocksPct, this will trade off increased memory for query processing at the expense of disk block caching. The defaults are 25 and 50 and normally we recommend you keep the total of these as 75 especially on a lower memory machine. If you have a multi node deployment, increase TotalUmMemory. Alternatively you need more physical memory.&lt;/p&gt;
