&lt;p&gt;DirectFS is a closed source filesystem that isn't being distributed any more by SanDisk who took over FusionIO. DirectFS was only for Fusion IO Atomic Gen 2 cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 3 cards requires the also closed source NVMFS which exposes the same atomic directives here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is right, the DirectFs references in this article and the rest of the kb should either be removed or quantified with its deprecated status or replaces with NVMFS.&lt;/p&gt;
