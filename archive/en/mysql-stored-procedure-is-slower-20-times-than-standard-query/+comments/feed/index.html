An UPDATE should have a well defined amount of rows affected by the query. Do you really need to update so many rows to achieve your business function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot guess how a SP time would be different to a direct query. If you can construct a repeatable test case to show this please create a bug report. If the direct query is doing it faster, then why not just use that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without details I cannot answer other performance questions.&lt;/p&gt;
