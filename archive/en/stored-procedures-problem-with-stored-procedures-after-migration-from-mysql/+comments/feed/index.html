This was happening because following the JDBC API,  a call to CallableStatement.executeQuery() must return a resultset (method inheritance from  &lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html#executeQuery("&gt;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html#executeQuery(&lt;/a&gt;))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll tell if i'm correct, but i assume the query {call spmzBenutzer(...)} must not have any resultset. That why this exception was thrown.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree this is too harsh. Version 1.4 is released with a rewritten implementation of CallableStatement. Now, In this case, no exception is thrown, just an empty resultset (i've just test it and this is similar to what the MySQL connector is doing).&lt;/p&gt;
