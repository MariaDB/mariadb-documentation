It's better to create an issue here &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/&lt;/a&gt; - please push there the button "Create, select in open dialog project "MariaDB Connector/ODBC", and describe the issue.
At the moment I don't have Access 2016 to try to repeat your problem. Please provide  in your issue report ODBC trace of your unsuccessful table linking attempt.
And there is already 3.0.6 version out. There is always a chance that the problem is solved there.&lt;/p&gt;
