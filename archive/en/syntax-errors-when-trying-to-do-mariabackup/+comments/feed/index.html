It's meant to be run from the command line, not from inside the client. As a primer, you may find &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB4ImmmzXqU"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB4ImmmzXqU&lt;/a&gt;, from the MariaDB Foundation YouTube channel, useful.&lt;/p&gt;

The error is very general just stating that I have an error in the syntax without giving any details.&lt;/p&gt;

I was not aware that I needed to to a "prepare stage" Is there a place that could help me find a good example to prepare the stage and then do the backup? I am very new to this process. Also, I do not want to upgrade anything until I can get the basics working with the current version, but appreciate the tip!&lt;/p&gt;

What are teh syntax errors? 10.3.10 is really old. There are two years of bug fixes to the latest 10.3.27 version.&lt;/p&gt;
