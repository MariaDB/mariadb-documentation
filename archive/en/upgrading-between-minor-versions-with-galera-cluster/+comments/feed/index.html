On a Debian machines there is startup-script (/etc/mysql/debian-start) which runs mysql_upgrade on each start. I was just wondering, if I should remove this script (and run it manually) or add the --skip-write-brinlog to it.... (it's a galera cluster)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default is write_binlog = false anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mariadb-upgrade --help | grep ^write-binlog
write-binlog                      FALSE&lt;/p&gt;
