&lt;p&gt;I really couldn't determine the what is a normal amount of IOPS, from my findings the InnoDB buffer pool seems to be in a normal state, the disk usage isn't that high but there is a lot of writing while the application has almost no users on it. All these writings are being made by the application in a 'idle' state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've attached an updated on the changes that I've made, and also attached all the screenshots that you might find useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really appreciate your help :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried setting it to 0 but nothing really changed. Thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don't have 2000 IOPs available then this can cause excess CPU use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you don't have sufficient innodb_buffer_pool_size for your active working set of data then a lot of CPU will be used decrypting the recently read data from disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the &lt;strong&gt;SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'innodb_buffer_pool%'&lt;/strong&gt; status variables and others related to encryption and also calculate the number of IOPs available on your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
