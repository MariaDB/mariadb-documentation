PHP's &lt;em&gt;mySQLi&lt;/em&gt; class similarly won't show the result set if you send the query with its &lt;em&gt;query&lt;/em&gt; method; you need to use the &lt;em&gt;multi_query&lt;/em&gt; method to send the query and then you'll be able to obtain the result set. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;$db-&amp;gt;multi_query('DELETE FROM mytable WHERE status = 7 RETURNING *');
$result = $db-&amp;gt;store_result();
$rowsDeleted = $db-&amp;gt;affected_rows;

(For an in-memory table, that would mean explicit_bzero; for one stored on disk, it'd mean what the wipe(1) command does in the Debian package wipe.)&lt;/p&gt;
