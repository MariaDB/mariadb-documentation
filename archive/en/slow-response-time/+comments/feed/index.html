&lt;p&gt;There are some specific queries which are performing slowly, one of them takes 37sec and return around 600 records, I have seen explain plan, it show full table scans for some of tables involved. Indexes are created on columns which are used in where clause but are not being used.
Query has few joins, union, sub query, order by clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

You've identified slow queries, so next you could use &lt;a href="/kb/en/explain/"&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/a&gt; (EXTENDED) on these queries, see what the optimizer plan is, whether they're indexed properly. Most causes of slow queries are problems with indexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your reply, I want to know that despite increasing memory parameters most of sql queries are still slow. Normally when you increase these parameters, performance gets improved (to some extent), but in my case it is not. How can I diagnose what is reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

Search for specific &lt;a href="/kb/en/slow-query-log/"&gt;slow queries&lt;/a&gt; and then look into why they are slow.&lt;/p&gt;
