&lt;p&gt;You can query the &lt;a href="/kb/en/mysqluser-table/"&gt;mysql.user&lt;/a&gt; table to view which host/users have been set up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;select host, user, password from mysql.user;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the passwords are hashed, so you will not be able to view the passwords used.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks. Now, I replaced what you said was object-oriented. I just copied the Example #1 mysqli_connect() from &lt;a href="http://uk1.php.net/manual/en/function.mysqli-connect.php"&gt;http://uk1.php.net/manual/en/function.mysqli-connect.php&lt;/a&gt;
and I think it has given me its reason why I cannot connect:
Debugging errno: 1045
Debugging error: Access denied for user 'iph'@'localhost' (using password: YES) 
Now I have 2 questions: Where do I look up error numbers like 1045? and how in MariaDB do I check which user name and password I managed to set up for myself and therefore what values I should be using in this function call?!  I am afraid that I find the website documentation labyrithine and perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;

You need to either use the procedural-style or object-oriented style. Your code as you have pasted it does not work, as it mixes styles.&lt;/p&gt;

However I do not understand what you advise. I do not know how to  look at the web server error log, but since mysqli_error() returned nothing, I do not expect there to be anything in it. And then what do you mean by "go into object-oriented style"? Do you mean try to look at $mysqli-&amp;gt;connect_errno etc.? If they are just there why does this matter? But they returned nothing. If you want me NOT to go anywhere near "object-oriented style", what is the PHP error variable that I should look at other than my invocation of the SQL database function mysqli_error(), which returned nothing?
I looked at the link you gave; it is to the page headed mysqli::$error and says that the thing referred to "Returns the last error message for the most recent MySQLi function call". As I say, the usual function call for that returns nothing so the above appear to be PHP code niceties whereas if the database error mechanism returns nothing, the important question is why can't I connect to the database?! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why has nobody published a clear complete guide to how to create the PHP code to do this basic, surely universally needed thing?! I can't find a simple example of a connection function with error reporting, so I could just copy the vanilla basic routine that actually works. 
Thanks again for any further help you can give; and ... anybody else have any advice? I am at a loss because after a lifetime in the business I find a total absence of fundamental information about what is required and where and how to find out what has gone wrong in all this.&lt;/p&gt;

Take a look at your web server error log, and then take a look at the PHP manual to fix this. For example, &lt;code&gt;$mysqli&lt;/code&gt; will be undefined because you connect in a procedural style, but then go into object-oriented style after that. See for example &lt;a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.error.php"&gt;http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.error.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Are you certain you have the correct users and rights to do what you want to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you connect from the same host using the same login credentials using a different client, such as the mysql CLI? Is your database on the same host as your PHP process? Have you tried (temporarily!) using the root credentials with your mysqli_connect() call?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;give the error message, and a sample of the code you are using to connect, at a minimum to help you with your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
