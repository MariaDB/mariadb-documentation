Problem was I couldn't run mhysql_upgrade because the server wouldn't start.  I was trying to go from 5.5 to 10.3 directly. I did get it to go to 10.0, and it started up but nothing could connect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What i had missed though was the part:   'Set innodb_fast_shutdown to 0. '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will have to try with that - the odd thing though is a smaller version of the same databases upgraded seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;
