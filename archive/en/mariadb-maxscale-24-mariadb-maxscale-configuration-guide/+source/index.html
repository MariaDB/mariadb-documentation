[TOC]

# Introduction

This document describes how to configure MariaDB MaxScale and presents some
possible usage scenarios. MariaDB MaxScale is designed with flexibility in mind,
and consists of an event processing core with various support functions and
plugin modules that tailor the behavior of the program.

# Concepts

## Glossary

Word | Description
--------------------|----------------------------------------------------
connection routing  | Connection routing is a method of handling requests in which MariaDB MaxScale will accept connections from a client and route data on that connection to a single database using a single connection. Connection based routing will not examine individual requests on a connection and it will not move that connection once it is established.
statement routing   | Statement routing is a method of handling requests in which each request within a connection will be handled individually. Requests may be sent to one or more servers and connections may be dynamically added or removed from the session.
module              | A module is a separate code entity that may be loaded dynamically into MariaDB MaxScale to increase the available functionality. Modules are implemented as run-time loadable shared objects.
connection failover | When a connection currently being used between MariaDB MaxScale and the database server fails a replacement will be automatically created to another server by MariaDB MaxScale without client intervention
backend database    | A term used to refer to a database that sits behind MariaDB MaxScale and is accessed by applications via MariaDB MaxScale.
REST API | HTTP administrative interface

## Objects

### Server

A server represents an individual database server to which a client can be
connected via MariaDB MaxScale. The status of a server varies during the lifetime
of the server and typically the status is updated by some monitor. However, it
is also possible to update the status of a server manually.

Status | Description
-------|------------
Running       | The server is running.
Master        | The server is the master.
Slave         | The server is a slave.
Draining      | The server is being drained. Existing connections can continue to be used, but no new connections will be created to the server. Typically this status bit is turned on manually using _maxctrl_, but a monitor may also turn it on.
Drained       | The server has been drained. The server was being drained and now the number of connections to the server has dropped to 0.
Auth Error    | The monitor cannot login and query the server due to insufficient privileges.
Maintenance   | The server is under maintenance. Typically this status bit is turned on manually using _maxctrl_, but it will also be turned on for a server that for some reason is blocking connections from MaxScale. When a server is in maintenace mode, no connections will be created to it and existing connections will be closed.
Slave of External Master | The server is a slave of a master that is not being monitored.

### Protocol

A protocol module is responsible for the low-level communication between
MaxScale and either clients of MaxScale or servers exposed by MaxScale.
The most commonly used protocol modules are `mariadbclient` and
`mariadbbackend`.

Protocol modules do not have sections of their own in the MaxScale
configuration file, but are referred to from _servers_ and _listeners_.

### Monitor

A monitor module is capable of monitoring the state of a particular kind
of cluster and making that state available to the routers of MaxScale.

Examples of monitor modules are `mariadbmon` that is capable of monitoring
a regular master-slave cluster and in addition of performing both _switchover_
and _failover_, `galeramon` that is capable of monitoring a Galera cluster,
`csmon` that is capable of monitoring a Columnstore cluster and `clustrixmon`
that is capable of monitoring a Clustrix cluster.

Monitor modules have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration
file.

### Filter

A filter module resides in front of routers in the request processing chain
of MaxScale. That is, a filter will see a request before it reaches the router
and before a response is sent back to the client. This allows filters to
reject, handle, alter or log information about a request.

Examples of filters are `dbfwfilter` that is a configurable firewall, `cache`
that provides query caching according to rules, `regexfilter` that can rewrite
requests according to regular expressions, and `qlafilter` that logs
information about requests.

Filters have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file that are
referred to from _services_.

### Router

A router module is capable of routing requests to backend servers according to
the characteristics of a request and/or the algorithm the router
implements. Examples of routers are `readconnroute` that provides _connection
routing_, that is, the server is chosen according to specified rules when the
session is created and all requests are subsequently routed to that server,
and `readwritesplit` that provides _statement routing_, that is, each
individual request is routed to the most appropriate server.

Routers do not have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file,
but are referred to from _services_.

### Service

A service abstracts a set of databases and makes them appear as a single one
to the client. Depending on what router (e.g. `readconnroute` or
`readwritesplit`) the service uses, the servers are used in some particular
way. If the service uses filters, then all requests will be pre-processed in
some way before they reach the router.

Services have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file.

### Listener

A listener defines a port MaxScale listens on. Connection requests arriving on
that port will be forwarded to the service the listener is associated with. A
listener may be associated with a single service, but several listeners may be
associated with the same service.

Listeners have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file.

# Administration

The administation of MaxScale can be divided in two parts:

* Writing the MaxScale configuration file, which is described in the following
  [section](#configuration).
* Performing runtime modifications using [MaxCtrl](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxctrl)
  or [MaxAdmin](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxadmin-admin-interface).

For detailed information about _MaxAdmin_ and _MaxCtrl_ please refer to the
specific documentation referred to above. In the following it will only be
explained how MaxAdmin and MaxCtrl relate to each other, as far as user
credentials go.

MaxAdmin can connect to MaxScale either using Unix (domain) sockets or
TCP/IP sockets. In the former case, the user is identified using her
Linux credentials and by default `root` can access.

MaxCtrl can only connect using TCP/IP sockets. When connecting with
MaxCtrl or with MaxAdmin using TCP/IP sockets, the user and password
must be provided and are checked against a separate user credentials
database. By default, that database contains the user `admin` whose
password is `mariadb`.

Note that the database is shared between MaxAdmin and MaxCtrl, that is,
if a user is deleted via MaxAdmin, then it will also no longer be possible
to use that user with MaxCtrl. Similarly, a user created using MaxAdmin
or MaxCtrl can be used with either MaxAdmin or MaxCtrl.

Note that if MaxAdmin (when used over a TCP/IP socket) or MaxCtrl are
invoked without explicitly providing a user and password then they will
by default use `admin` and `mariadb`. That means that when the default
user is removed, the credentials must always be provided.

# Configuration

The MariaDB MaxScale configuration is read from a file that MariaDB MaxScale
will look for in the following places:

1. By default, the file `maxscale.cnf` in the directory `/etc`
2. The location given with the `--configdir=&lt;path&gt;` command line argument.

MariaDB MaxScale will further look for a directory with the same name as the
configuration file, followed by `.d` (for instance `/etc/maxscale.cnf.d`) and
recursively read all files, having a `.cnf` suffix, it finds in the directory
hierarchy. All other files will be ignored.

There are no restrictions on how different configuration sections are arranged,
but the strong suggestion is to place global settings into the configuration
file MariaDB MaxScale is invoked with, and then, if deemed necessary, create
separate configuration files for _servers_, _filters_, etc.

The configuration file itself is based on the
[.ini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) file format and consists of
various sections that are used to build the configuration; these sections define
services, servers, listeners, monitors and global settings. Parameters, which
expect a comma-separated list of values can be defined on multiple lines. The
following is an example of a multi-line definition.

```
[MyService]
type=service
router=readconnroute
servers=server1,
        server2,
        server3
```

The values of the parameter that are not on the first line need to have at least
one whitespace character before them in order for them to be recognized as a
part of the multi-line parameter.

Comments are defined by prefixing a row with a hash (`#`). Trailing comments are
not supported.

```
# This is a comment before a parameter
some_parameter=123
```

## Names

Section names may not contain whitespace and must not start with the characters
`@@`, but otherwise there are no restrictions.

## Special Parameter Types

### Sizes

Where _specifically noted_, a number denoting a size can be suffixed by a subset
of the IEC binary prefixes or the SI prefixes. In the former case the number
will be interpreted as a certain multiple of 1024 and in the latter case as a
certain multiple of 1000. The supported IEC binary suffixes are `Ki`, `Mi`, `Gi`
and `Ti` and the supported SI suffixes are `k`, `M`, `G` and `T`. In both cases,
the matching is case insensitive.

For instance, the following entries
```
max_size=1099511628000
max_size=1073741824Ki
max_size=1048576Mi
max_size=1024Gi
max_size=1Ti
```
are equivalent, as are the following
```
max_size=1000000000000
max_size=1000000000k
max_size=1000000M
max_size=1000G
max_size=1T
```

### Durations

A number denoting a duration can be suffixed by one of the case-insensitive
suffixes `h`, `m`, `s` and `ms`, for specifying durations in hours, minutes,
seconds and milliseconds, respectively.

For instance, the following entries
```
soft_ttl=1h
soft_ttl=60m
soft_ttl=3600s
soft_ttl=3600000ms
```
are equivalent.

Note that if an explicit unit is not specified, then it is specific to the
configuration parameter whether the duration is interpreted as seconds or
milliseconds.

_Not_ providing an explicit unit has been deprecated in MaxScale 2.4.

### Regular Expressions

Many modules have settings which accept a regular expression. In most cases, these
settings are named either *match* or *exclude*, and are used to filter users or queries.
MaxScale uses the [PCRE2-library](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/) for matching
regular expressions.

When writing a regular expression (regex) type parameter to a MaxScale configuration file,
the pattern string should be enclosed in slashes e.g. `^select` -&gt; `match=/^select/`. This
clarifies where the pattern begins and ends, even if it includes whitespace. Without
slashes the configuration loader trims the pattern from the ends. The slashes are removed
before compiling the pattern. For backwards compatibility, the slashes are not yet
mandatory. Omitting them is, however, deprecated and will be rejected in a future release
of MaxScale. Currently, *binlogfilter*, *ccrfilter*, *qlafilter*, *tee* and *avrorouter*
accept parameters in this type of regular expression form. Some other modules may not
handle the slashes yet correctly.

PCRE2 supports a complicated regular expression
[syntax](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html). MaxScale typically uses
regular expressions simply, only checking whether the pattern and subject match at some
point. For example, using the QLAFilter and setting `match=/SELECT/` causes the filter to
accept any query with the text &#34;SELECT&#34; somewhere within. To force the pattern to only
match at the beginning of the query, set `match=/^SELECT/`. To only match the end, set
`match=/SELECT$/`.

Modules which accept regular expression parameters also often accept options which affect
how the patterns are compiled. Typically, this setting is called *options* and accepts
values such as `ignorecase`, `case` and `extended`. `ignorecase` causes the regular
expression matcher to ignore letter case, and is often on by default. `extended` ignores
whitespace in the pattern. `case` turns on case-sensitive matching. These settings can
also be defined in the pattern itself, so they can be used even in modules without
pattern compilation settings. The pattern settings are `(?i)` for `ignorecase` and `(?x)`
for `extended`. See the
[PCRE2 syntax documentation](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html#SEC16)
for more information.

#### Standard regular expression settings for filters

Many filters use the settings *match*, *exclude* and *options*. Since these settings are
used in a similar way across these filters, the settings are explained here. The
documentation of the filters link here and describe any exceptions to this
generalized explanation.

These settings typically limit the queries the filter module acts on. *match* and
*exclude* define PCRE2 regular expression patterns while *options* affects how both of the
patterns are compiled. *options* works as explained above, accepting the values
`ignorecase`, `case` and `extended`, with `ignorecase` being the default.

The queries are matched as they arrive to the filter on their way to a routing module. If
*match* is defined, the filter only acts on queries matching that pattern. If *match* is
not defined, all queries are considered to match.

If *exclude* is defined, the filter only acts on queries not matching that pattern. If
*exclude* is not defined, nothing is excluded.

If both are defined, the query needs to match *match* but not match *exclude*.

Even if a filter does not act on a query, the query is not lost. The query is simply
passed on to the next module in the processing chain as if the filter was not there.

## Global Settings

The global settings, in a section named `[MaxScale]`, allow various parameters
that affect MariaDB MaxScale as a whole to be tuned. This section must be
defined in the root configuration file which by default is `/etc/maxscale.cnf`.

### `threads`

This parameter controls the number of worker threads that are handling the
events coming from the kernel. The default is 1 thread. It is recommended that
you start with one thread and increase the number if you require greater
performance. Increasing the amount of worker threads beyond the number of
processor cores does not improve the performance, rather is likely to degrade
it, and can consume resources needlessly.

You can enable automatic configuration of this value by setting the value to
`auto`. This way MariaDB MaxScale will detect the number of available processors
and set the amount of threads to be equal to that number. This should only be
used for systems dedicated for running MariaDB MaxScale.

```
# Valid options are:
#       threads=[&lt;number of threads&gt; | auto ]

[MaxScale]
threads=1
```

Additional threads will be created to execute other internal services within
MariaDB MaxScale. This setting is used to configure the number of threads that
will be used to manage the user connections.

### `thread_stack_size`

Ignored and deprecated in 2.3.

If you need to explicitly set the stack size, do so using `ulimit -s` before
starting MaxScale.

### `auth_connect_timeout`

The connection timeout in seconds for the MySQL connections to the backend
server when user authentication data is fetched. Increasing the value of this
parameter will cause MariaDB MaxScale to wait longer for a response from the
backend server before aborting the authentication process. The default is 3
seconds.

```
auth_connect_timeout=10s
```

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `auth_read_timeout`

The read timeout in seconds for the MySQL connection to the backend database
when user authentication data is fetched. Increasing the value of this parameter
will cause MariaDB MaxScale to wait longer for a response from the backend
server when user data is being actively fetched. If the authentication is
failing and you either have a large number of database users and grants or the
connection to the backend servers is slow, it is a good idea to increase this
value. The default is 1 second.

```
auth_read_timeout=10s
```

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `auth_write_timeout`

The write timeout in seconds for the MySQL connection to the backend database
when user authentication data is fetched. Currently MariaDB MaxScale does not
write or modify the data in the backend server. The default is 2 seconds.

```
auth_write_timeout=10s
```

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `query_retries`

The number of times an interrupted internal query will be retried. The default
is to retry the query once. This feature was added in MaxScale 2.1.10 and was
disabled by default until MaxScale 2.3.0.

An interrupted query is any query that is interrupted by a network
error. Connection timeouts are included in network errors and thus is it
advisable to make sure that the value of `query_retry_timeout` is set to an
adequate value. Internal queries are only used to retrieve authentication data
and monitor the servers.

### `query_retry_timeout`

The total timeout in seconds for any retried queries. The default value is 5
seconds.

An interrupted query is retried for either the configured amount of attempts or
until the configured timeout is reached.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `passive`

Controls whether MaxScale is a passive node in a cluster of multiple MaxScale
instances. The default value is false.

This parameter is intended to be used with multiple MaxScale instances that use
failover functionality to manipulate the cluster in some form. Passive nodes
only observe the clusters being monitored and take no direct actions.

The following functionality is disabled when passive mode is enabled:

 * Automatic failover in the `mariadbmon` module
 * Automatic rejoin in the `mariadbmon` module
 * Launching of monitor scripts

**NOTE:** Even if MaxScale is in passive mode, it will still accept clients and
  route any traffic sent to it. The **only** operations affected by the passive
  mode are the ones listed above.

### `ms_timestamp`

Enable or disable the high precision timestamps in logfiles. Enabling this adds
millisecond precision to all logfile timestamps.

```
# Valid options are:
#       ms_timestamp=&lt;0|1&gt;
ms_timestamp=1
```

### `skip_permission_checks`

Skip service and monitor user permission checks. This is useful when you know
the permissions are OK and you want to speed up the startup process. This
parameter takes a boolean value and is disabled by default.

It is recommended to not disable the permission checks so that any missing
privileges are detected when maxscale is starting up. If you are experiencing a
slow startup of MaxScale due to large amounts of connection timeouts when
permissions are checked, disabling the permission checks could speed up the
startup process.

```
skip_permission_checks=true
```

### `syslog`

Enable or disable the logging of messages to *syslog*.

By default logging to *syslog* is enabled.

```
# Valid options are:
#       syslog=&lt;0|1&gt;
syslog=1
```

To enable logging to syslog use the value 1 and to disable use the value 0.

### `maxlog`

Enable to disable to logging of messages to MariaDB MaxScale&#39;s log file.

By default logging to *maxlog* is enabled.

```
# Valid options are:
#       syslog=&lt;0|1&gt;
maxlog=1
```

To enable logging to the MariaDB MaxScale log file use the value 1 and to
disable use the value 0.

### `log_to_shm`

**Note:** This parameter has been removed in 2.4.0: do not use it

In older MaxScale versions, the actual log file was created in `/dev/shm` and
a symbolic link to that file was stored in place of the normal MaxScale log.
If you want to store the log in shared memory, define the directory with
`logdir` in `/dev/shm`.

### `log_warning`

Enable or disable the logging of messages whose syslog priority is *warning*.
Messages of this priority are enabled by default.

```
# Valid options are:
#       log_warning=&lt;0|1&gt;
log_warning=0
```

To disable these messages use the value 0 and to enable them use the value 1.

### `log_notice`

Enable or disable the logging of messages whose syslog priority is *notice*.
Messages of this priority provide information about the functioning of MariaDB
MaxScale and are enabled by default.

```
# Valid options are:
#       log_notice=&lt;0|1&gt;
log_notice=0
```

To disable these messages use the value 0 and to enable them use the value 1.

### `log_info`

Enable or disable the logging of messages whose syslog priority is *info*. These
messages provide detailed information about the internal workings of MariaDB
MaxScale and should not, due to their frequency, be enabled, unless there is a
specific reason for that. For instance, from these messages it will be evident,
e.g., why a particular query was routed to the master instead of to a slave.
These informational messages are disabled by default.

```
# Valid options are:
#       log_info=&lt;0|1&gt;
log_info=1
```

To disable these messages use the value 0 and to enable them use the value 1.

### `log_debug`

Enable or disable the logging of messages whose syslog priority is *debug*. This
kind of messages are intended for development purposes and are disabled by
default. Note that if MariaDB MaxScale has been built in release mode, then
debug messages are excluded from the build and this setting will not have any
effect.

```
# Valid options are:
#       log_debug=&lt;0|1&gt;
log_debug=1
```

To disable these messages use the value 0 and to enable them use the value 1.

### `log_messages`

**Deprecated** Use *log_notice* instead.

### `log_trace`

**Deprecated** Use *log_info* instead.

### `log_augmentation`

Enable or disable the augmentation of messages. If this is enabled, then each
logged message is appended with the name of the function where the message was
logged. This is primarily for development purposes and hence is disabled by
default.

```
# Valid options are:
#       log_augmentation=&lt;0|1&gt;
log_augmentation=1
```

To disable the augmentation use the value 0 and to enable it use the value 1.

### `log_throttling`

It is possible that a particular error (or warning) is logged over and over
again, if the cause for the error persistently remains. To prevent the log from
flooding, it is possible to specify how many times a particular error may be
logged within a time period, before the logging of that error is suppressed for
a while.

```
# A valid value looks like
#       log_throttling = X, Y, Z
#
# where the first value X is a positive integer and means the number of times
# a specific error may be logged within a duration of Y, before the logging
# of that error is suppressed for a duration of Z.
log_throttling=8, 2s, 15000ms
```

In the example above, the logging of a particular error will be suppressed for
15 seconds if the error has been logged 8 times in 2 seconds.

The default is `10, 1000ms, 10000ms`, which means that if the same error is
logged 10 times in one second, the logging of that error is suppressed for the
following 10 seconds.

To disable log throttling, add an entry with an empty value

```
log_throttling=
```
or one where any of the integers is 0.

```
log_throttling=0, 0, 0
```
The durations can be specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit
unit is provided, the value is interpreted as milliseconds in MaxScale 2.4. In
subsequent versions a value without a unit may be rejected.

Note that *notice*, *info* and *debug* messages are never throttled.

### `logdir`

Set the directory where the logfiles are stored. The folder needs to be both
readable and writable by the user running MariaDB MaxScale.

```
logdir=/tmp/
```

### `datadir`

Set the directory where the data files used by MariaDB MaxScale are stored.
Modules can write to this directory and for example the binlogrouter uses this
folder as the default location for storing binary logs.

This is also the directory where the password encryption key is read from that
is generated by `maxkeys`.

```
datadir=/home/user/maxscale_data/
```

### `libdir`

Set the directory where MariaDB MaxScale looks for modules. The library
directory is the only directory that MariaDB MaxScale uses when it searches for
modules. If you have custom modules for MariaDB MaxScale, make sure you have
them in this folder.

```
libdir=/home/user/lib64/
```

### `cachedir`

Configure the directory MariaDB MaxScale uses to store cached data. An example
of cached data is the authentication data fetched from the backend servers.
MariaDB MaxScale stores this in case a connection to the backend server is not
possible.

```
cachedir=/tmp/maxscale_cache/
```

### `piddir`

Configure the directory for the PID file for MariaDB MaxScale. This file
contains the Process ID for the running MariaDB MaxScale process.

```
piddir=/tmp/maxscale_cache/
```

### `execdir`

Configure the directory where the executable files reside. All internal
processes which are launched will use this directory to look for executable
files.

```
execdir=/usr/local/bin/
```

### `connector_plugindir`

Location of the MariaDB Connector-C plugin directory. The MariaDB Connector-C
used in MaxScale can use this directory to load authentication plugins. The
versions of the plugins must be binary compatible with the connector version
that MaxScale was built with.

```
connector_plugindir=/usr/lib/plugin/
```

### `persistdir`

Configure the directory where persisted configurations are stored. When a new
server is created via MaxAdmin, it will be stored in this directory. Do not use
or modify the contents of this directory, use _/etc/maxscale.cnf.d/_ instead.

```
persistdir=/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/
```

### `module_configdir`

Configure the directory where module configurations are stored. Path arguments
are resolved relative to this directory. This directory should be used to store
module specific configurations e.g. dbfwfilter rule files.

Any configuration parameter that is not an absolute path will be interpreted as
a relative path. The relative paths use the module configuration directory as
the working directory.

For example, the configuration parameter `file=my_file.txt` would be interpreted
as `/etc/maxscale.cnf.d/my_file.txt` whereas `file=/home/user/my_file.txt` would
be interpreted as `/home/user/my_file.txt`.

```
module_configdir=/var/lib/maxscale/
```

### `language`

Set the folder where the errmsg.sys file is located in. MariaDB MaxScale will
look for the errmsg.sys file installed with MariaDB MaxScale from this folder.

```
language=/home/user/lang/
```

### `query_classifier`

The module used by MariaDB MaxScale for query classification. The information
provided by this module is used by MariaDB MaxScale when deciding where a
particular statement should be sent. The default query classifier is
_qc_sqlite_.

### `query_classifier_cache_size`

Specifies the maximum size of the query classifier cache. The default limit is
15% of total system memory starting with MaxScale 2.3.7. In older versions the
default limit was 40% of total system memory. This feature was added in MaxScale
2.3.0.

When the query classifier cache has been enabled, MaxScale will, after a
statement has been parsed, store the classification result using the
canonicalized version of the statement as the key.

If the classification result for a statement is needed, MaxScale will first
canonicalize the statement and check whether the result can be found in the
cache.  If it can, the statement will not be parsed at all but the cached result
is used.

The configuration parameter takes one integer that specifies the maximum size of
the cache. The size of the cache can be specifed as explained [here](#sizes).

```
# 1MB query classifier cache
query_classifier_cache_size=1MB
```

Note that MaxScale uses a separate cache for each worker thread. To obtain the
amount of memory available for each thread, divide the cache size with the value
of `threads`. If statements are evicted from the cache (visible in the
diagnostic output), consider increasing the cache size.

Using `maxctrl show threads` it is possible to check what the actual size of
the cache is and to see performance statistics.

Key|Meaning
---|-------
QC cache size|The current size of the cache (bytes).
QC cache inserts|How many entries have been inserted into the cache.
QC cache hits|How many times the classification result has been found from the cache.
QC cache misses|How many times the classification result has not been found from the cache, but the classification had to be performed.
QC cache evictions|How many times a cache entry has had to be removed from the cache, in order to make place for another.

### `query_classifier_args`

Arguments for the query classifier. What arguments are accepted depends on the
particular query classifier being used. The default query classifier -
_qc_sqlite_ - supports the following arguments:

#### `log_unrecognized_statements`

An integer argument taking the following values:
   * 0: Nothing is logged. This is the default.
   * 1: Statements that cannot be parsed completely are logged. They may have been
partially parsed, or classified based on keyword matching.
   * 2: Statements that cannot even be partially parsed are logged. They may have
been classified based on keyword matching.
   * 3: Statements that cannot even be classified by keyword matching are logged.

```
query_classifier=qc_sqlite
query_classifier_args=log_unrecognized_statements=1
```

This will log all statements that cannot be parsed completely. This may be
useful if you suspect that MariaDB MaxScale routes statements to the wrong
server (e.g. to a slave instead of to a master).

### `substitute_variables`

Enable or disable the substitution of environment variables in the MaxScale
configuration file. If the substitution of variables is enabled and a
configuration line like
```
some_parameter=$SOME_VALUE
```
is encountered, then `$SOME_VALUE` will be replaced with the actual value
of the environment variable `SOME_VALUE`. Note:
* Variable substitution will be made _only_ if &#39;$&#39; is the first character
  of the value.
* _Everything_ following &#39;$&#39; is interpreted as the name of the environment
  variable.
* Referring to a non-existing environment variable is a fatal error.

By default, the value of `substitute_variables` is `false`.
```
substitute_variables=true
```
The setting of `substitute_variables` will have an effect on all parameters
in the all other sections, irrespective of where the `[maxscale]` section
is placed in the configuration file. However, in the `[maxscale]` section,
to ensure that substitution will take place, place the
`substitute_variables=true` line first.

### `sql_mode`

Specifies whether the query classifier parser should initially expect _MariaDB_
or _PL/SQL_ kind of SQL.

The allowed values are:
   `default`: The parser expects regular _MariaDB_ SQL.
   `oracle` : The parser expects PL/SQL.

```
sql_mode=oracle
```

The default value is `default`.

**NOTE** If `sql_mode` is set to `oracle`, then MaxScale will also assume
that `autocommit` initially is off.

At runtime, MariaDB MaxScale will recognize statements like
```
set sql_mode=oracle;
```
and
```
set sql_mode=default;
```
and change mode accordingly.

**NOTE** If `set sql_mode=oracle;` is encountered, then MaxScale will also
behave as if `autocommit` had been turned off and conversely, if
`set sql_mode=default;` is encountered, then MaxScale will also behave
as if `autocommit` had been turned on.

Note that MariaDB MaxScale is **not** explicitly aware of the sql mode of
the server, so the value of `sql_mode` should reflect the sql mode used
when the server is started.

### `local_address`

What specific local address/interface to use when connecting to servers.

This can be used for ensuring that MaxScale uses a particular interface
when connecting to servers, in case the computer MaxScale is running on
has multiple interfaces.
```
local_address=192.168.1.254
```

### `users_refresh_time`

How often, in seconds, MaxScale at most may refresh the users from the
backend server.

MaxScale will at startup load the users from the backend server, but if
the authentication of a user fails, MaxScale assumes it is because a new
user has been created and will thus refresh the users. By default, MaxScale
will do that at most once per 30 seconds and with this configuration option
that can be changed. A value of 0 allows infinite refreshes and a negative
value disables the refreshing entirelly. Note that using `maxadmin` it is
possible to explicitly cause the users of a service to be reloaded.

```
users_refresh_time=120s
```

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

In MaxScale 2.3.9 and older versions, the minimum allowed value was 10 seconds
but, due to a bug, the default value was 0 which allowed infinite refreshes.

### `retain_last_statements`

How many statements MaxScale should store for each session. This is for
debugging purposes, as in case of problems it is often of value to be able
to find out exactly what statements were sent before a particular
problem turned up.

**Note:** See also `dump_last_statements` using which the actual dumping
  of the statements is enabled. Unless both of the parameters are defined,
  the statement dumping mechanism doesn&#39;t work.

```
retain_last_statements=20
```

Default is `0`.

### `dump_last_statements`

With this configuration item it is specified in what circumstances MaxScale
should dump the last statements that a client sent. The allowed values are
`never`, `on_error` and `on_close`. With `never` the statements are never
logged, with `on_error` they are logged if the client closes the connection
improperly, and with `on_close` they are always logged when a client session
is closed.
```
dump_last_statements=on_error
```
Default is `never`.

Note that you need to specify with `retain_last_statements` how many statements
MaxScale should retain for each session. Unless it has been set to another value
than `0`, this configuration setting will not have an effect.

### `session_trace`

How many log entries are stored in the session specific trace log. This log is
written to disk when a session ends abnormally and can be used for debugging
purposes. It would be good to enable this if a session is disconnected and the
log is not detailed enough. In this case the info log might reveal the true
cause of why the connection was closed.

```
session_trace=20
```
Default is `0`.

The session trace log is also exposed by REST API and is shown with
`maxctrl show sessions`.

### `writeq_high_water`

High water mark for network write buffer. Controls when network traffic
throtting is started. The parameter accepts [size type values](#sizes).

More specifically, if the client side write queue is above this value, it will
block traffic coming from backend servers. If the backend side write queue is
above this value, it will block traffic from client. the minimum allowed size is
4096 bytes.

Only when both `writeq_high_water` and `writeq_low_water` are set, traffic
throtting is enabled. By default, traffic throttling is disabled.

### `writeq_low_water`

Low water mark for network write buffer. Once the traffic throttling is enabled,
it will only be disabled when the write queue is below `writeq_low_water`. The
parameter accepts [size type values](#sizes). The minimum allowed size is 512
bytes. `writeq_high_water` must always be greater than `writeq_low_water`.

### `load_persisted_configs`

Load persisted runtime changes on startup. This parameter accepts boolean values
and is enabled by default. This parameter was added in MaxScale 2.3.6.

All runtime configuration changes are persisted in generated configuration files
located by default in `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/` and are loaded on
startup after main configuration files have been read. To make runtime
configurations volatile (i.e. they are lost when maxscale is restarted), use
`load_persisted_configs=false`. All changes are still persisted since it stores
the current runtime state of MaxScale. This makes problem analysis easier if an
unexpected outage happens.

### `max_auth_errors_until_block`

The maximum number of authentication failures that are tolerated before a host
is temporarily blocked. The default value is 10 failures. After a host is
blocked, connections from it are rejected for 60 seconds. To disable this
feature, set the value to 0.

Note that the configured value is not a hard limit. The number of tolerated
failures is between `max_auth_errors_until_block` and `threads *
max_auth_errors_until_block` where `max_auth_errors_until_block` is the
configured value of this parameter and `threads` is the number of configured
threads.

### REST API Configuration

The MaxScale REST API is an HTTP interface that provides JSON format data
intended to be consumed by monitoring appllications and visualization tools.

The following options must be defined under the `[maxscale]` section in the
configuration file.

### `admin_host`

The network interface where the REST API listens on. The default value is the
IPv4 address `127.0.0.1` which only listens for local connections.

### `admin_port`

The port where the REST API listens on. The default value is port 8989.

### `admin_auth`

Enable REST API authentication using HTTP Basic Access
authentication. This is not a secure method of authentication without HTTPS but
it does add a small layer of security. This option is enabled by default.

The admin interface authentication uses the same user as MaxAdmin network
interface. This means that new users can be added with both MaxAdmin and the
REST API. The default credentials for the interface are `admin:mariadb`.

### `admin_ssl_key`

The path to the TLS private key in PEM format for the admin interface.

If the `admin_ssl_key` and `admin_ssl_cert` options are all defined, the admin
interface will use encrypted HTTPS instead of plain HTTP.

### `admin_ssl_cert`

The path to the TLS public certificate in PEM format. See `admin_ssl_key`
documentation for more details.

### `admin_ssl_ca_cert`

The path to the TLS CA certificate in PEM format. If defined, the client
certificate, if provided, will be validated against it. This parameter is
optional starting with MaxScale 2.3.19.

### `admin_enabled`

Enable or disable the admin interface. This allows the admin interface to
be completely disabled to prevent access to it.

### `admin_log_auth_failures`

Log authentication failures for the admin interface. This parameter expects a
boolean value and is enabled by default.

### `admin_pam_readwrite_service` and `admin_pam_readonly_service`

Use Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for REST API authentication. The settings
accept a PAM service name which is used during authentication if normal authentication
fails. `admin_pam_readwrite_service` should accept users who can do any
MaxCtrl/REST-API-operation. `admin_pam_readonly_service` should accept users who can only
do read operations. Because REST-API does not support back and forth communication between
the client and MaxScale, the PAM services must be simple. They should only ask for the
password and nothing else.

If only `admin_pam_readwrite_service` is configured, both read and write operations can be
authenticated by PAM. If only `admin_pam_readonly_service` is configured, only read
operations can be authenticated by PAM. If both are set, the service used is determined by
the requested operation. Leave or set both empty to disable PAM for REST-API.

## Events

MaxScale logs warnings and errors for various reasons and often it is self-
evident and generally applicable whether some occurence should warrant a
warning or an error, or perhaps just an info-level message.

However, there are events whose seriousness is not self-evident. For
instance, in some environments an authentication failure may simply indicate
that someone has made a typo, while in some other environment that can only
happen in case there has been a security breech.

To handle events like these, MaxScale defines _events_ whose logging
facility and level can be controlled by the administrator. Given an event
`X`, its facility and level are controlled in the following manner:
```
event.X.facility=LOG_LOCAL0
event.X.level=LOG_ERR
```
The above means that if event _X_ occurs, then that is logged using the
facility `LOG_LOCAL0` and the level `LOG_ERR`.

The valid values of facility` are the facility values reported by `man
syslog`, e.g. `LOG_AUTH`, `LOG_LOCAL0` and `LOG_USER`. Likewise, the valid
values for `level` are the ones also reported by `man syslog`,
e.g. `LOG_WARNING`, `LOG_ERR` and `LOG_CRIT`.

Note that MaxScale does not act upon the level, that is, even if the level
of a particular event is defined to be `LOG_EMERG`, MaxScale will not shut
down if that event occurs.

The default facility is `LOG_USER` and the default level is `LOG_WARNING`.

The available events are:

### &#39;authentication_failure&#39;

This event occurs when there is an authentication failure.
```
event.authentication_failure.facility=LOG_AUTH
event.authentication_failure.level=LOG_CRIT
```

## Service

A service represents the database service that MariaDB MaxScale offers to the
clients. In general a service consists of a set of backend database servers and
a routing algorithm that determines how MariaDB MaxScale decides to send
statements or route connections to those backend servers.

A service may be considered as a virtual database server that MariaDB MaxScale
makes available to its clients.

Several different services may be defined using the same set of backend servers.
For example a connection based routing service might be used by clients that
already performed internal read/write splitting, whilst a different statement
based router may be used by clients that are not written with this functionality
in place. Both sets of applications could access the same data in the same
databases.

A service is identified by a service name, which is the name of the
configuration file section and a type parameter of service.

```
[Test-Service]
type=service
```

In order for MariaDB MaxScale to forward any requests it must have at least one
service defined within the configuration file. The definition of a service alone
is not enough to allow MariaDB MaxScale to forward requests however, the service
is merely present to link together the other configuration elements.

### `router`

The router parameter of a service defines the name of the router module that
will be used to implement the routing algorithm between the client of MariaDB
MaxScale and the backend databases. Additionally routers may also be passed a
comma separated list of options that are used to control the behavior of the
routing algorithm. The two parameters that control the routing choice are router
and router_options. The router options are specific to a particular router and
are used to modify the behavior of the router. The read connection router can be
passed options of master, slave or synced, an example of configuring a service
to use this router and limiting the choice of servers to those in slave state
would be as follows.

```
router=readconnroute
router_options=slave
```

To change the router to connect on to servers in the  master state as well as
slave servers, the router options can be modified to include the master state.

```
router=readconnroute
router_options=master,slave
```

A more complete description of router options and what is available for a given
router is included with the documentation of the router itself.

### `router_options`

Option string given to the router module. The value of this parameter should be
a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. See router specific documentation for
more details.

### `filters`

The filters option allow a set of filters to be defined for a service; requests
from the client are passed through these filters before being sent to the router
for dispatch to the backend server.  The filters parameter takes one or more
filter names, as defined within the filter definition section of the
configuration file. Multiple filters are separated using the | character.

```
filters=counter | QLA
```

The requests pass through the filters from left to right in the order defined in
the configuration parameter.

### `servers`

The servers parameter in a service definition provides a comma separated list of
the backend servers that comprise the service. The server names are those used
in the name section of a block with a type parameter of server (see below).

```
servers=server1,server2,server3
```

*NOTE* The `servers` parameter is mutually exclusive with the `cluster` parameter.

### `cluster`

The servers the service uses are defined by the monitor specified as value
of this configuration parameter.

```
cluster=TheMonitor

```

*NOTE* The `clusters` parameter is mutually exclusive with the `servers` parameter.

### `user`

The user parameter, along with the password parameter are used to define the
credentials used to connect to the backend servers to extract the list of
database users from the backend database that is used for the client
authentication.

```
user=maxscale
password=Mhu87p2D
```

Authentication of incoming connections is performed by MariaDB MaxScale itself
rather than by the database server to which the client is connected. The client
will authenticate itself with MariaDB MaxScale, using the username, hostname and
password information that MariaDB MaxScale has extracted from the backend
database servers. For a detailed discussion of how this impacts the
authentication process please see the &#34;Authentication&#34; section below.

The host matching criteria is restricted to IPv4, IPv6 will be added in a future
release.

Existing user configuration in the backend databases must be checked and may be
updated before successful MariaDB MaxScale authentication:

In order for MariaDB MaxScale to obtain all the data it must be given a username
it can use to connect to the database and retrieve that data. This is the
parameter that gives MariaDB MaxScale the username to use for this purpose.

The account used must be able to select from the mysql.user table, the following
is an example showing how to create this user.

```
CREATE USER &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;maxscale-password&#39;;
```

Additionally, `SELECT` privileges on the `mysql.user`, `mysql.db` and `mysql.tables_priv`
tables and `SHOW DATABASES` privileges are required in order to load databases
name and grants suitable for database name authorization.

```
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.tables_priv TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.roles_mapping TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;
GRANT SHOW DATABASES ON *.* TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;

-- MariaDB from 10.2.2 to 10.2.10 requires extra grants
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;
```

**Note:** MariaDB versions 10.2.10 and older require a `SELECT` grant on
  `mysql.*` in addition to the normal grants. This is to work around MDEV-13453
  which was fixed in MariaDB 10.2.11.

If you are using MariaDB ColumnStore, the follwing grant is requried.

```
GRANT ALL ON infinidb_vtable.* TO &#39;maxscale&#39;@&#39;maxscalehost&#39;;
```

See [MaxScale Troubleshooting](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise/maxscale-troubleshooting/)
for more information on how to troubleshoot authentication related problems.

### `password`

The password parameter provides the password information for the above user and
may be either a plain text password or it may be an encrypted password.  See the
section on encrypting passwords for use in the maxscale.cnf file. This user must
be capable of connecting to the backend database and executing these SQL
statements to load database names and grants from the backends:

* `SELECT user, host, password,Select_priv FROM mysql.user`.
* `SELECT user, host, db FROM mysql.db`
* `SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA`
* `SELECT GRANTEE,PRIVILEGE_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_PRIVILEGES`

**Note:** In older versions of MaxScale this parameter was called `passwd`. The
  use of `passwd` was deprecated in MaxScale 2.3.0.

### `enable_root_user`

This parameter controls the ability of the root user to connect to MariaDB
MaxScale and hence onwards to the backend servers via MariaDB MaxScale.

The default value is `0`, disabling the ability of the root user to connect to
MariaDB MaxScale.

Example for enabling root user:

```
enable_root_user=1
```

Values of `on` or `true` may also be given to enable the root user and `off` or
`false` may be given to disable the use of the root user.

```
enable_root_user=true
```

### `localhost_match_wildcard_host`

This parameter enables matching of local addresses (i.e. `127.0.0.1`) against
the wildcard host, `%`, for authentication. This parameter is enabled by
default.

If this parameter is disabled, in order to authenticate a connection from the
same machine as the one on which MariaDB MaxScale is running, an explicit
user@localhost entry will be required in the MySQL user table.

### `version_string`

This parameter sets a custom version string that is sent in the MySQL Handshake
from MariaDB MaxScale to clients.

Example:

```
version_string=5.5.37-MariaDB-RWsplit
```

If not set, the default value is `5.5.5-10.0.0 MaxScale &lt;MaxScale version&gt;`
where `&lt;MaxScale version&gt;` is the version of MaxScale. If the provided string
does not start with the number 5, a 5.5.5- prefix will be added to it. This
means that a _version_string_ value of _MaxScale-Service_ would result in a
_5.5.5-MaxScale-Service_ being sent to the client.

### `weightby`

**Note:** This parameter has been deprecated in MaxScale 2.3.2.
[A rank mechanism](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/blob/develop/Documentation/Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#rank)
will be added in MaxScale 2.4 to allow better control over server usage.

The weightby parameter is used in conjunction with server parameters in order to
control the load balancing applied in the router in use by the service. This
allows varying weights to be applied to each server to create a non-uniform
distribution of the load amongst the servers.

An example of this might be to define a parameter for each server that
represents the amount of resource available on the server, we could call this
serversize. Every server should then have a serversize parameter set for the
server.

```
serversize=10
```

The service would then have the parameter `weightby=serv_weight`. If there are 4
servers defined in the service (serverA, serverB, serverC and serverD) with the
serversize set as shown in the table below, the connections would balanced using
the percentages in this table.

 Server  |serversize|% connections
---------|----------|-------------
serverA  |   10     |     18%
serverB  |   15     |     27%
serverC  |   10     |     18%
serverD  |   20     |     36%

_**Note**: If the value of the weighting parameter of an individual server is
zero or the relative weight rounds down to zero, no queries will be routed to
that server as long as a server with a positive weight is available._

Here is an excerpt from an example configuration with the `serv_weight`
parameter used as the weighting parameter.

```
[server1]
type=server
address=127.0.0.1
port=3000
protocol=MariaDBBackend
serv_weight=3

[server2]
type=server
address=127.0.0.1
port=3001
protocol=MariaDBBackend
serv_weight=1

[Read-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
servers=server1,server2
weightby=serv_weight
```

With this configuration and a heavy query load, the server _server1_ will get
most of the connections and about a third of the remaining queries are routed to
the second server. With server weights, you can assign secondary servers that
are only used when the primary server is under heavy load.

Without the weightby parameter, each connection counts as a single connection.
With a weighting parameter, a single connection received its weight from the
server&#39;s own weighting parameter divided by the sum of all weighting parameters
in all the configured servers.

If we use the previous configuration as an example, the sum of the `serv_weight`
parameter is 4. _Server1_ would receive a weight of `3/4=75%` and _server2_
would get `1/4=25%`. This means that _server1_ would get 75% of the connections
and _server2_ would get 25% of the connections.

### `auth_all_servers`

This parameter controls whether only a single server or all of the servers are
used when loading the users from the backend servers. This takes a boolean value
and when enabled, creates a union of all the users and grants on all the
servers.

### `strip_db_esc`

The strip_db_esc parameter strips escape characters from database names of
grants when loading the users from the backend server.

This parameter takes a boolean value and when enabled, will strip all backslash (`\`)
characters from the database names. The default value for this parameter is true
since MaxScale 2.0.1. In previous version, the default value was false.

Some visual database management tools automatically escape some characters and
this might cause conflicts when MariaDB MaxScale tries to authenticate users.

### `retry_on_failure`

**Note:** This feature is ignored by MaxScale 2.4 and will be removed in future
  versions. This is due to the fact that a failure to bind to a network
  interface is a serious error which should always be investigated and is not
  related to network outages.

The retry_on_failure parameter controls whether MariaDB MaxScale will try to
restart failed services and accepts a boolean value. This functionality is
enabled by default to prevent services being permanently disabled if the
starting of the service failed due to a network outage. Disabling the restarting
of the failed services will cause them to be permanently disabled if the
services can&#39;t be started when MariaDB MaxScale is started.

### `log_auth_warnings`

Enable or disable the logging of authentication failures and warnings. This
parameter takes a boolean value.

MariaDB MaxScale normally suppresses warning messages about failed
authentication. Enabling this option will log those messages into the message
log with details about who tried to connect to MariaDB MaxScale and from where.

### `connection_timeout`

The connection_timeout parameter is used to disconnect sessions to MariaDB
MaxScale that have been idle for too long. The session timeouts are disabled by
default. To enable them, define the timeout in seconds in the service&#39;s
configuration section. A value of zero is interpreted as no timeout, the same
as if the parameter is not defined.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

**Warning:** If a connection is idle for longer than the configured connection
timeout, it will be forcefully disconnected and a warning will be logged in the
MaxScale log file. If you are performing long-running maintenance operations
(e.g. `ALTER TABLE`) either do them with a direct connection to the server or
set `connection_timeout` to zero before executing them.

Example:

```
[Test-Service]
connection_timeout=300s
```

### `max_connections`

The maximum number of simultaneous connections MaxScale should permit to this
service. If the parameter is zero or is omitted, there is no limit. Any attempt
to make more connections after the limit is reached will result in a &#34;Too many
connections&#34; error being returned.

Example:

```
[Test-Service]
max_connections=100
```

### `max_retry_interval`

**Note:** This feature has been removed from MaxScale 2.4. See
  [`retry_on_failure`](#retry_on_failure) for more details.

Configure the maximum interval between consecutive attempts to bind to an
interface. The default value for this parameter is 3600 seconds. This
parameter was introduced in MaxScale 2.2.0.

When a listener fails to bind to the interface it is assigned to, it will
attempt to bind to the interface again after 10 seconds. If the attempt fails,
the interval is incremented by 10 seconds and the next attempt will be in 20
seconds. The interval is incremented until the value of `max_retry_interval` is
reached at which point the listener attempts to bind to the interface every
`max_retry_interval` seconds.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the interval is seconds, an interval specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `session_track_trx_state`

Enable or disable session transaction state tracking by offloading it to the backend servers.
Getting current session transaction state from server side will be more accurate for that state
inside stored procedures or prepare statments will be handle properly, and that is also faster
as no parsing is needed on MaxScale.

This is only supported by MariaDB versions 10.3 or newer. Default is false.
The following Server side config is needed too.

```
session_track_state_change = ON
session_track_transaction_info = CHARACTERISTICS
```

### `retain_last_statements`

How many statements MaxScale should store for each session of this service.
This overrides the value of the global setting with the same name. If
`retain_last_statements` has been specified in the global section of the
MaxScale configuration file, then if it has _not_ been explicitly specified
for the service, the global value holds, otherwise the service specific
value rules. That is, it is possible to enable the setting globally and
turn it off for a specific service, or just enable it for specific services.

The value of this parameter can be changed at runtime using `maxctrl` and the
new value will take effect for sessions created thereafter.

```
maxctrl alter service MyService retain_last_statements 5
```

### `net_write_timeout`

This parameter controls how long a network write to the client can stay
buffered. This feature is disabled by default.

When `net_write_timeout` is configured and data is buffered on the client
network connection, if the time since the last successful network write exceeds
the configured limit, the client connection will be disconnected.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

## Server

Server sections are used to define the backend database servers that can be
formed into a service. A server may be a member of one or more services within
MariaDB MaxScale. Servers are identified by a server name which is the section
name in the configuration file. Servers have a type parameter of server, plus
address port and protocol parameters.

```
[server1]
type=server
address=127.0.0.1
port=3000
protocol=MariaDBBackend
```

### `address`

The IP address or hostname of the machine running the database server that is
being defined. MariaDB MaxScale will use this address to connect to the backend
database server.

### `port`

The port on which the database listens for incoming connections. MariaDB
MaxScale will use this port to connect to the database server. The default value
is 3306.

### `socket`

The absolute path to a UNIX domain socket the MariaDB server is listening
on. Either `address` or `socket` must be defined and defining them both is an
error.

### `protocol`

The name for the protocol module to use to connect MariaDB MaxScale to the
database. Currently only one backend protocol is supported, the MariaDBBackend
module.

### `monitoruser`

The monitor has a username and password that is used to connect to all servers
for monitoring purposes, this may be overridden by supplying a monitoruser
statement for each individual server.

```
monitoruser=mymonitoruser
```

### `monitorpw`

The monitor has a username and password that is used to connect to all servers
for monitoring purposes, this may be overridden by supplying a `monitorpw`
for the individual servers.

```
monitorpw=mymonitorpasswd
```

The `monitorpw` parameter may be either a plain text password or it may be an
encrypted password.  See the section on encrypting passwords for use in the
maxscale.cnf file.

### `extra_port`

An alternative port used to monitor the server. This allows MaxScale to connect
even when `max_connections` has been reached on the backend server. If this
parameter is defined and a connection to the normal port fails, the alternative
port is used.

For more information, read the
[extra_port documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/thread-pool-system-and-status-variables/#extra_port).

### `persistpoolmax`

The `persistpoolmax` parameter defaults to zero but can be set to an integer
value for a back end server. If it is non zero, then when a DCB connected to a
back end server is discarded by the system, it will be held in a pool for reuse,
remaining connected to the back end server. If the number of DCBs in the pool
has reached the value given by `persistpoolmax` then any further DCB that is
discarded will not be retained, but disconnected and discarded.

### `persistmaxtime`

The `persistmaxtime` parameter defaults to zero but can be set to a duration
as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit is provided, the value
is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent versions a value
without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity of the
parameter is seconds, a value specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

A DCB placed in the persistent pool for a
server will only be reused if the elapsed time since it joined the pool is less
than the given value. Otherwise, the DCB will be discarded and the connection
closed.

For more information about persistent connections, please read the
[Administration Tutorial](node:maxscale-24-tutorials-mariadb-maxscale-administration-tutorial).

### `proxy_protocol`

If `proxy_protocol` is set to `on`, MaxScale will send a
[PROXY protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt)
header when connecting client sessions to the server. The header contains the
original client IP address and port, as seen by MaxScale. The server will then
read the header and perform authentication as if the connection originated from
this address instead of MaxScale&#39;s IP address. With this feature, the user
accounts on the backend server can be simplified to only contain the actual
client hosts and not the MaxScale host.

PROXY protocol will be supported by MariaDB 10.3, which this feature has been
tested with. To use it, enable the PROXY protocol in MaxScale for every
compatible server and configure the MariaDB servers themselves to accept the
protocol headers from MaxScale&#39;s IP address. On the server side, the protocol
should be enabled  only for trusted IPs, as it allows the sender to spoof the
connection origin. If a proxy header is sent to a server not expecting it, the
connection will fail. Usually PROXY protocol should be enabled for every
server in a cluster, as they typically have similar grants.

Other SQL-servers may support PROXY protocol as well, but the implementation may
be highly restricting. Strict adherence to the protocol requires that the
backend server does not allow mixing of un-proxied and proxied connections from
a given IP. MaxScale requires normal connections to backends for monitoring and
authentication data queries, which would be blocked. To bypass this restriction,
the server monitor needs to be disabled and the service listener needs to be
configured to disregard authentication errors (`skip_authentication=true`).
Server states also need to be set manually in MaxAdmin. These steps are *not*
required for MariaDB 10.3, since its implementation is more flexible and allows
both PROXY-headered and headerless connections from a proxy-enabled IP.

### `authenticator`

The authenticator module to use. Each protocol module defines a default
authentication module which is used if no `authenticator` parameter is found
from the configuration.

### `authenticator_options`

Removed feature. Only client authenticator modules have options, in the listener
definition. Server authenticator options in the config file are ignored.

### `disk_space_threshold`

This parameter specifies how full a disk may be, before MaxScale should start
logging warnings or take other actions (e.g. perform a switchover). This
functionality will only work with MariaDB server versions 10.1.32, 10.2.14 and
10.3.6 onwards, if the `DISKS` _information schema plugin_ has been installed.

**NOTE**: In future MariaDB versions, the information will be available _only_ if
the monitor user has the `FILE` privilege.

A limit is specified as a path followed by a colon and a percentage specifying
how full the corresponding disk may be, before action is taken. E.g. an entry like
```
/data:80
```
specifies that the disk that has been mounted on `/data` may be used until 80%
of the total space has been consumed. Multiple entries can be specified by
separating them by a comma. If the path is specified using `*`, then the limit
applies to all disks. However, the value of `*` is only applied if there is not
an exact match.

Note that if a particular disk has been mounted on several paths, only one path
need to be specified. If several are specified, then the one with the smallest
percentage will be applied.

Examples:
```
disk_space_threshold=*:80
disk_space_threshold=/data:80
disk_space_threshold=/data1:80,/data2:60,*:90
```
The last line means that the disk mounted at `/data1` may be used up to
80%, the disk mounted at `/data2` may be used up to 60% and all other disks
mounted at any paths may be used up until 90% of maximum capacity, before
MaxScale starts to warn to take action.

Note that the path to be used, is one of the paths returned by:
```
&gt; use information_schema;
&gt; select * from disks;
+-----------+----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------+
| Disk      | Path                 | Total     | Used     | Available |
+-----------+----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------+
| /dev/sda3 | /                    |  47929956 | 34332348 |  11139820 |
| /dev/sdb1 | /data                | 961301832 |    83764 | 912363644 |
...
```

There is no default value, but this parameter must be explicitly specified
if the disk space situation should be monitored.

### `rank`

This parameter controls the order in which servers are used. Valid values for
this parameter are `primary` and `secondary`. The default value is
`primary`. This parameter replaces the use of the `weightby` parameter as the
primary means of controlling server usage.

This behavior depends on the router implementation but the general rule of thumb
is that primary servers will be used before secondary servers.

Readconnroute will always use primary servers before secondary servers as long
as they match the configured server type.

Readwritesplit will pick servers that have the same rank as the current
master. Read the
[readwritesplit documentation on server ranks](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-readwritesplit#server-ranks)
for a detailed description of the behavior.

The following example server configuration demonstrates how `rank` can be used
to exclude `DR-site` servers from routing.

```
[main-site-master]
type=server
address=192.168.0.11
protocol=MariaDBBackend
rank=primary

[main-site-slave]
type=server
address=192.168.0.12
protocol=MariaDBBackend
rank=primary

[DR-site-master]
type=server
address=192.168.0.21
protocol=MariaDBBackend
rank=secondary

[DR-site-slave]
type=server
address=192.168.0.22
protocol=MariaDBBackend
rank=secondary
```

The `main-site-master` and `main-site-slave` servers will be used as long as
they are available. When they are no longer available, the `DR-site-master` and
`DR-site-slave` will be used.

## Monitor

Monitor sections are used to define the monitoring module that watches a set of
servers. Each server can only be monitored by one monitor.

Common monitor parameters [can be found here](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-common-monitor-parameters).

## Listener

The listener defines a port and protocol pair that is used to listen for
connections to a service. A service may have multiple listeners associated with
it, either to support multiple protocols or multiple ports. As with other
elements of the configuration the section name is the listener name and it can
be selected freely. A type parameter is used to identify the section as a
listener definition. Address is optional and it allows the user to limit
connections to certain interface only. Socket is also optional and used for Unix
socket connections.

The network socket where the listener listens will have a backlog of
connections. The size of this backlog is controlled by the
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog and net.core.somaxconn kernel parameters.

Increasing the size of the backlog by modifying the kernel parameters helps with
sudden connection spikes and rejected connections. For more information see
[listen(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html).

```
[&lt;Listener name&gt;]
type=listener
service=&lt;Service name&gt;]
protocol=[MariaDBClient|HTTPD]
address=[IP|hostname]
port=&lt;Listen port number&gt;
```

### `service`

The service to which the listener is associated. This is the name of a service
that is defined elsewhere in the configuration file.

### `protocol`

The name of the protocol module that is used for the communication between the
client and MariaDB MaxScale itself.

### `address`

The address option sets the address that will be used to bind the listening
socket. The address may be specified as an IP address in &#39;dot notation&#39; or as a
hostname. If the address option is not included in the listener definition the
listener will bind to all network interfaces.

### `port`

The port to use to listen for incoming connections to MariaDB MaxScale from the
clients. If the port is omitted from the configuration a default port for the
protocol will be used.

### `socket`

The `socket` option may be included in a listener definition, this configures
the listener to use Unix domain sockets to listen for incoming connections. The
parameter value given is the name of the socket to use.

**Note:** If you want to use both network ports and UNIX domain sockets
  with a service, define two separate listeners that connect to the same
  service.

### `authenticator`

The authenticator module to use. Each protocol module defines a default
authentication module which is used if no `authenticator` parameter is found
from the configuration.

### `authenticator_options`

Option string given to the authenticator module. The value of this parameter
should be a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. See authenticator specific
documentation for more details.

# Available Protocols

The protocols supported by MariaDB MaxScale are implemented as external modules
that are loaded dynamically into the MariaDB MaxScale core. They allow MariaDB
MaxScale to communicate in various protocols both on the client side and the
backend side. Each of the protocols can be either a client protocol or a backend
protocol. Client protocols are used for client-MariaDB MaxScale communication
and backend protocols are for MariaDB MaxScale-database communication.

## `MariaDBClient`

This is the implementation of the MySQL protocol that is used by clients of
MariaDB MaxScale to connect to MariaDB MaxScale.

## `MariaDBBackend`

The MariaDBBackend protocol module is the implementation of the protocol that
MariaDB MaxScale uses to connect to the backend MariaDB, MySQL and Percona
Server databases. This implementation is tailored for the MariaDB MaxScale to
MySQL Database traffic and is not a general purpose implementation of the MySQL
protocol.

## `maxscaled`

*Note:* This module is deprecated.

The protocol used used by the maxadmin client application in order to connect to
MariaDB MaxScale and access the command line interface.

## `HTTPD`

*Note:* This module is deprecated: use the REST API instead.

This protocol module is currently still under development, it provides a means
to create HTTP connections to MariaDB MaxScale for use by web browsers or
RESTful API clients.

# TLS/SSL encryption

This section describes configuration parameters for both servers and listeners
that control the TLS/SSL encryption method and the various certificate files
involved in it.

To enable TLS/SSL for a listener, you must set the `ssl` parameter to
`true` and provide at least the `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` parameters.

To enable TLS/SSL for a server, you must set the `ssl` parameter to
`true`. If the backend database server has certificate verification
enabled, the `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` parameters must also be defined.

Custom CA certificates can be defined with the `ssl_ca_cert` parameter.

After this, MaxScale connections between the server and/or the client will be
encrypted. Note that the database must also be configured to use TLS/SSL
connections if backend connection encryption is used.

**Note:** MaxScale does not allow mixed use of TLS/SSL and normal connections on
  the same port.

If TLS encryption is enabled for a listener, any unencrypted connections to it
will be rejected. MaxScale does this to improve security by preventing
accidental creation of unencrypted connections.

The separation of secure and insecure connections differs from the MariaDB
server which allows both secure and insecure connections on the same port. As
MaxScale is the gateway through which all connections go, in order to guarantee
a more secure system MaxScale enforces a stricter security policy than what the
server does.

### `ssl`

This enables SSL connections when set to true. The parameter takes a boolean
value and is disabled by default. The parameter also accepts the special values
`required` and `disabled` which were the only supported values before MaxScale
2.3.0.

If enabled, the certificate files mentioned above must also be
supplied. MaxScale connections to will then be encrypted with TLS/SSL.

### `ssl_key`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be the SSL client private key MaxScale should use. This is a required
parameter for listeners but an optional parameter for servers.

### `ssl_cert`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be the SSL client certificate MaxScale should use with the server. The
certificate must match the key defined in `ssl_key`. This is a required
parameter for listeners but an optional parameter for servers.

### `ssl_ca_cert`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the CA that signed the
certificate referred to in the previous parameter. It will be used to verify
that the certificate is valid. This is a required parameter for both listeners
and servers. The CA certificate can consist of a certificate chain.

### `ssl_version`

**Note:** It is highly recommended to leave this parameter to the default value
  of _MAX_. This will guarantee that the strongest available encryption is used.
  **Do not change this unless you know what you are doing**.

This parameter controls the level of encryption used. Accepted values are:

 * TLSv10
 * TLSv11
 * TLSv12
 * TLSv13
 * MAX

The default is to use the highest level of encryption available that both the
client and server support. MaxScale supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and
TLSv1.3 depending on the OpenSSL library version.

The `TLSv13` value was added in MaxScale 2.3.15 ([MXS-2762](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-2762)).

### `ssl_cipher`

Set the list of TLS ciphers. By default, no explicit ciphers are defined and the
system defaults are used. Note that this parameter does not modify TLSv1.3
ciphers.

### `ssl_cert_verify_depth`

The maximum length of the certificate authority chain that will be accepted. The
default value is 9, same as the OpenSSL default. The configured value must be
larger than 0.

### `ssl_verify_peer_certificate`

Peer certificate verification. This functionality is disabled by default. In
versions prior to 2.3.17 the feature was enabled by default.

When this feature is enabled, the peer must send a certificate. The certificate
sent by the peer is verified against the configured Certificate Authority to
make sure the peer is who they claim to be. For listeners, this behaves as if
`REQUIRE X509` was defined for all users. For servers, this behaves like the
`--ssl-verify-server-cert` command line option for the `mysql` client.

#### Example SSL enabled server configuration

```
[server1]
type=server
address=10.131.24.62
port=3306
protocol=MariaDBBackend
ssl=required
ssl_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.max-client.pem
ssl_key=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/key.max-client.pem
ssl_ca_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.ca.maxscale.pem
```

This example configuration requires all connections to this server to be
encrypted with SSL. The paths to the certificate files and the Certificate
Authority file are also provided.

#### Example SSL enabled listener configuration

```
[RW-Split-Listener]
type=listener
service=RW-Split-Router
protocol=MariaDBClient
port=3306
ssl=required
ssl_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.maxscale.pem
ssl_key=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/key.csr.maxscale.pem
ssl_ca_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.ca.maxscale.pem
```

This example configuration requires all connections to be encrypted with
SSL. The paths to the certificate files and the Certificate Authority file are
also provided.

# Module Types

## Routing Modules

The main task of MariaDB MaxScale is to accept database connections from client
applications and route the connections or the statements sent over those
connections to the various services supported by MariaDB MaxScale.

Currently a number of routing modules are available, these are designed for a
range of different needs.

Connection based load balancing:
* [ReadConnRoute](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-readconnroute)

Read/Write aware statement based router:
* [ReadWriteSplit](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-readwritesplit)

Simple sharding on database level:
* [SchemaRouter](node:schemarouter)

Binary log server:
* [Binlogrouter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-binlogrouter)

## Monitor Modules

Monitor modules are used by MariaDB MaxScale to internally monitor the state of
the backend databases in order to set the server flags for each of those
servers. The router modules then use these flags to determine if the particular
server is a suitable destination for routing connections for particular query
classifications. The monitors are run within separate threads of MariaDB
MaxScale and do not affect MariaDB MaxScale&#39;s routing performance.

* [MariaDB Monitor](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-mariadb-monitor)
* [Galera Monitor](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-galera-monitor)

The use of monitors in MaxScale is not absolutely mandatory: it is possible to
run MariaDB MaxScale without a monitor module. In this case an external
monitoring system must the status of each server via MaxCtrl or the REST
API. **Only do this if you know what you are doing.**

## Filter Modules

![image alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/2.4.19/Documentation/Getting-Started/images/image_10.png)

Filters provide a means to manipulate or process requests as they pass through
MariaDB MaxScale between the client side protocol and the query router. A full
explanation of each filter&#39;s functionality can be found in its documentation.

The [Filter Tutorial](node:9077) document shows how you
can add a filter to a service and combine multiple filters in one service.

* [Query Log All (QLA) Filter](node:filters-query-log-all-filter)
* [Regular Expression Filter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-regex-filter)
* [Tee Filter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-tee-filter)
* [Top Filter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-top-filter)
* [Database Firewall Filter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-database-firewall-filter)
* [Query Redirection Filter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-named-server-filter)
* [RabbitMQ Filter](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-rabbitmq-filter)

# Encrypting Passwords

Passwords stored in the maxscale.cnf file may optionally be encrypted for added security.
This is done by creation of an encryption key on installation of MariaDB MaxScale.
Encryption keys may be created manually by executing the maxkeys utility with the argument
of the filename to store the key. The default location MariaDB MaxScale stores
the keys is `/var/lib/maxscale`. The passwords are encrypted using 256-bit AES CBC encryption.

```
 # Usage: maxkeys [PATH]
maxkeys /var/lib/maxscale/
```

Changing the encryption key for MariaDB MaxScale will invalidate any currently
encrypted keys stored in the maxscale.cnf file.

## Creating Encrypted Passwords

Encrypted passwords are created by executing the maxpasswd command with the location
of the .secrets file and the password you require to encrypt as an argument.

```
# Usage: maxpasswd PATH PASSWORD
maxpasswd /var/lib/maxscale/ MaxScalePw001
61DD955512C39A4A8BC4BB1E5F116705
```

The output of the maxpasswd command is a hexadecimal string, this should be inserted
into the maxscale.cnf file in place of the ordinary, plain text, password.
MariaDB MaxScale will determine this as an encrypted password and automatically decrypt
it before sending it the database server.

```
[Split-Service]
type=service
router=readwritesplit
servers=server1,server2,server3,server4
user=maxscale
password=61DD955512C39A4A8BC4BB1E5F116705
```

# Runtime Configuration Changes

Read the following documents for different methods of altering the MaxScale
configuration at runtime.

* MaxCtrl
  * [`create`](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxctrl#create)
  * [`destroy`](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxctrl#destroy)
  * [`add`](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxctrl#add)
  * [`remove`](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxctrl#remove)
  * [`alter`](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxctrl#alter)

* [REST API](node:9045) documentation

* MaxAdmin (deprecated)
  * [Runtime Configuration Changes](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-maxadmin-admin-interface#runtime-configuration-changes)

All changes to the configuration are persisted as individual configuration files
in `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/`. These files are applied after the main
configuration file and all auxiliary configurations have been loaded. This means
that once runtime configurations have been made, they need to be incorporated
into the main configuration files.

## Backing Up Configuration Changes

The combination of configuration files can be done either manually
(e.g. `rsync`) or with the `maxscale --export-config=FILE` command line
option. See `maxscale --help` for more information about how to use the
`--export-config` flag.

For example, to export the current runtime configuration, run the following
command.

```
maxscale --export-config=/tmp/maxscale.cnf.combined
```

This will create the `/tmp/maxscale.cnf.combined` file and write the current
configuration into the it. This allows new MaxScale instances to be easily set
up without requiring copying of all runtime configuration files. The user
executing the command must be able to read all MaxScale configuration files as
well as create and write the provided filename.

# Error Reporting

MariaDB MaxScale is designed to be executed as a service, therefore all error
reports, including configuration errors, are written to the MariaDB MaxScale
error log file. By default, MariaDB MaxScale will log to a file in
`/var/log/maxscale` and the system log.

# Limitations

The current limitations of MaxScale are listed in the [Limitations](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-limitations-and-known-issues-within-mariadb-maxscale) document.

# Troubleshooting

For a list of common problems and their solutions, read the
[MaxScale Troubleshooting](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/maxscale-troubleshooting/)
article on the MariaDB Knowledge Base.

## Authentication

MariaDB uses username, passwords and the client host in order to authenticate a
user, so a typical user would be defined as user X at host Y and would be given
a password to connect. MariaDB MaxScale uses exactly the same rules as MariaDB
when users connect to the MariaDB MaxScale instance, i.e. it will check the
address from which the client is connecting and treat this in exactly the same
way that MariaDB would. MariaDB MaxScale will pull the authentication data from
one of the backend servers (a master server if one is available) and use this to
match the incoming connections. MaxScale assumes that all the backend servers
for a particular service will share the same set of user credentials.

It is important to understand, however, that when MariaDB MaxScale itself makes
connections to the backend servers the backend server will see all connections
as originating from the host that runs MariaDB MaxScale and not the original
host from which the client connected to MariaDB MaxScale. Therefore the backend
servers should be configured to allow connections from the MariaDB MaxScale host
for every user that can connect from any host. Since there is only a single
password within the database server for a given host, this limits the
configuration such that a given user name must have the same password for every
host from which they can connect. These limitations do not apply when
[`proxy_protocol`](#proxy_protocol) is in use.

To clarify, if a user *X* is defined as using password *pass1* from host *A* and
*pass2* from host *B* then there must be an entry in the `user` table for user
*X* from the MariaDB MaxScale host, say *pass1*.

This would result in rows in the user table as follows

Username|Password|Client Host
--------|--------|-----------
   X    |  pass1 | A
   X    |  pass2 | B
   X    |  pass1 | MaxScale

In this case the user *X* would be able to connect to MariaDB MaxScale from host
a giving the password of *pass1*. In addition MariaDB MaxScale would be able to
create connections for this user to the backend servers using the username *X*
and password *pass1*, since the MariaDB MaxScale host is also defined to have
password *pass1*. User *X* would not however be able to connect from host *b*
since they would need to provide the password *pass2* in order to connect to
MariaDB MaxScale, but then MariaDB MaxScale would not be able to connect to the
backends as it would also use the password *pass2* for these connections.

### Wildcard Hosts

Hostname mapping in MariaDB MaxScale works in exactly the same way as for MariaDB,
if the wildcard is used for the host then any host other than the localhost
(127.0.0.1) will match. It is important to consider that the localhost check
will be performed at the MariaDB MaxScale level and at the MariaDB server level.

If MariaDB MaxScale and the databases are on separate hosts there are two
important changes in behavior to consider:

1. Clients running on the same machine as the backend database now may access
the database using the wildcard entry. The localhost check between the client
and MariaDB MaxScale will allow the use of the wildcard, since the client is not
running on the MariaDB MaxScale host. Also the wildcard entry can be used on the
database host as MariaDB MaxScale is making that connection and it is not
running on the same host as the database.

2. Clients running on the same host as MariaDB MaxScale can not access the
database via MariaDB MaxScale using the wildcard entry since the connection to
MariaDB MaxScale will be from the localhost. These clients are able to access
the database directly, as they will use the wildcard entry. This behavior can be
configured with the
[`localhost_match_wildcard_host`](#localhost_match_wildcard_host) option.

If MariaDB MaxScale is running on the same host as one or more of the database
nodes to which it is routing statements then the wildcard host entries can be
used to connect to MariaDB MaxScale but not to connect onwards to the database
running on the same node.

In all these cases the issue may be solved by adding an explicit entry for the
localhost address that has the same password as the wildcard entry. This may be
done using a statement as below for each of the databases that are required:

```
MariaDB [mysql]&gt; GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP ON employee.* &#39;user1&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;xxx&#39;;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

## Systemd Watchdog

If MaxScale is running as a systemd service, the systemd Watchdog will be
enabled by default. To configure it, change the `WatchdogSec` option in the
Service section of the maxscale systemd configuration file located in
`/lib/systemd/system/maxscale.service`:

```
WatchdogSec=30s
```

It is not recommended to use a watchdog timeout less than 30 seconds. When
enabled MaxScale will check that all threads are running and notify systemd
with a &#34;keep-alive ping&#34;.
