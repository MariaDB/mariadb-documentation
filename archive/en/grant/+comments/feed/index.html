It's the definer, not the invoker, that must have the TRIGGER privilege for the trigger to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the MySQL documentation page for GRANT we have this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The _ and % wildcards are permitted when specifying database names in GRANT statements that grant privileges at the database level (GRANT ... ON db_name.*). This means, for example, that to use a _ character as part of a database name, specify it using the \ escape character as \_ in the GRANT statement, to prevent the user from being able to access additional databases matching the wildcard pattern (for example, GRANT ... ON `foo\_bar`.* TO ...).&lt;/p&gt;

This made me somewhat anxious because you'd either had to give users also the right to manipulate triggers to have them executed or WITHOUT this privilege triggers aren't fired and the integrity of the data would be in jeopardy. -- Having tested this I can say: This is obviously NOT, what the documentation text means - &lt;strong&gt;triggers are firing ALSO WITHOUT the TRIGGER privilege.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This seems to be wrong. REPLICA MONITOR is the privilege for that (which is described in detail in its own section).
The section REPLICATION CLIENT should also mention that it now longer allows SHOW SLAVE STATUS since 10.5.2 (I assume).&lt;/p&gt;

This also grants the DROP privilege on all tables in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that should read  "on all tables &lt;strong&gt;and views&lt;/strong&gt; in the database."&lt;/p&gt;
