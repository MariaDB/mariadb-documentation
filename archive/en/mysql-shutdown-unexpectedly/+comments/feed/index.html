What does that look like? Are you starting MySQL and MariaDB is already started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I did is click on Start (MySQL) button in XAMPP control panel. Before MySQL would start and now it refuse to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Server socket created on...&lt;/em&gt; is a successful startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of messages between 15:11:13 and 15:11:36 could indicate it was hard killed by the server (out of memory)? or a user instigated hard process kill.&lt;/p&gt;
