&lt;p&gt;Yes, move ib_logfile0 back and don't touch it. The existence of these forms of bad advices on multiple forums as resulted in many corrupt database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its likely that the upgrade wants a clean shutdown in which case start up the previous version and shut it down cleanly. Ensure compose doesn't get impatient and kill it off during the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the clean shutdown is performed, try the new version again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow running containers is likely to be a different problem. Increased --innodb-buffer-pool-size=512M as an argument or &lt;a href="https://mysqlperf.github.io/mysql/skrunfilter/"&gt;kernel related&lt;/a&gt; (I can tell your on an old kernel due to ENOSYS for uring).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was easier to re-create the 2 proxies that I had setup than to fix the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only enough another docker container with mariadb upgraded without problem...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I put it back and grab a new excerpt from the log?&lt;/p&gt;
