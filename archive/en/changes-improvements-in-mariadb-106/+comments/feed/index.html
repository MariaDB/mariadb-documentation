&lt;p&gt;This is marked "Major" priority and is coming on 4 years since this item was added &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-13756"&gt;MDEV-13756&lt;/a&gt; so if it can make the release it would be a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also:
2 years since mysql 
20 years (!) since mssql server rtm
delivered on this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am aware there's a kludge of a workaround but it is a pain plus would stop this statement just being ignored as it currently the case.
Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

would it be possible to implement Partial / Filtered Indexes in 10.6 &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-15140"&gt;MDEV-15140&lt;/a&gt;? All other DB systems supports it (except MySQL and MariaDB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no fix version nor assignee in &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-15140"&gt;MDEV-15140&lt;/a&gt;. So it is not in "10.6 Features/fixes by vote" list. Yet request has 12 votes. It seems to be somehow lost in system.&lt;/p&gt;
