Sadly, I'm trying to fit fixing this in around work, so if I seem unresponsive it's that and not ingratitude!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let you know how things go when I get the time to follow up. Thanks once again.&lt;/p&gt;

The refused connection is caused by the crash, connections will be refused after the crash untll the MariaDB server has completed restarting again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason could be that the wordpress size that causes the problem is using a specific query or usage pattern that triggers the bug in MariaDB. One such problem that was already reported is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33533"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33533&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check if this looks similar to your problem. Otherwise, you can use that bug for inspiration about how to file a bug about your issue.&lt;/p&gt;
