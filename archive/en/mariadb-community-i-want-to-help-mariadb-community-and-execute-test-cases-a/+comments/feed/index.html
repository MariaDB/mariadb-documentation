&lt;p&gt;1) Writing totally new tests and running them. &lt;br&gt;
The main result of this activity is bug reports that you submit, describing the bugs that your tests found, and offering a way to reproduce these bugs reliably. 
If that's what you want to do, the same comment above is true for you: choose the component(s) that you want to test, choose tools that you want to use, run tests, optionally describe what you are doing in JIRA, submit bug reports in JIRA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Writing test cases for previously encountered bugs which don't have a known reliable way to reproduce them. &lt;br&gt;
Quite often people file bugs saying "I observed this or that, but I have no idea how to repeat it". Finding a way to reproduce such bugs is a very useful activity, although not an easy thing to do. 
If that's what you want to do, monitor JIRA or other internet sources where people complain about problems, when you notice such complaints, try to reproduce them, and file a bug report with the test case or update one that is already filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Writing test cases for bugfixes. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;While in previous two options you can choose your own tools, this one is mainly the MTR activity.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Generally, every bug fix in MariaDB or MySQL should come with a regression test case. Unfortunately, it is a common situation nowadays that MySQL bugfixes come without public test cases. Creating test cases for them is an extremely useful activity which the community could benefit from, but it requires very deep understanding of the code; certain bzr skills; knowledge of MTR; some mind-reading capabilities are also a plus. If you feel it's something you are up to, pick up MySQL source tree, check the history, find bugfixes which do not have any test cases; and try to create a test case which fails before the bug fix, but passes afterwards. If you manage to do it, file a JIRA report for MariaDB saying that you created a test case for this or that revision and attach your test case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start from here: &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/quality/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/quality/&lt;/a&gt; 
Some information might be outdated, but it will give you rough ideas of what is being done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as a QA analyst you must know that the most efficient way to help is to do something that is *not* being done yet. Since it's open source, you can just choose components you are interested in, create your own test plan, choose tools that you find most appropriate, and execute tests in a way that is most suitable for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure which components to choose, we can suggest you some that currently require testing efforts the most. But how you work on them will be still up to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep track of your activity and let us know about it, you can create a JIRA task and update it with information about what you are doing. It is not strictly necessary though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If as a result of this activity you find bugs, you will check them against existing reports in JIRA, and if they have not been filed yet, you will create reproducible test cases and will submit them. &lt;/p&gt;
