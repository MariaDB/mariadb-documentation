&lt;p&gt;In the end, this issue had nothing to do with the "doublewrite buffer". Or, signs pointing to the doublewrite buffer were misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real issue was related to a "spatial index" which had become corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping and re-creating the index fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are correct that I mentioned the new version incorrectly- I should have said 10.11.4 and not 10.11.44. We chose that version simply because it is the next major version that AWS supports, beyond 10.6.*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for more log details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time the database instance starts, the following warning is logged in AWS Logs &amp;amp; events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Binlog position from crash recovery is mysql-bin-changelog.312191 663"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 to 4 minutes later, this event is logged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The database is using the doublewrite buffer. RDS Optimized Writes is incompatible with the storage configuration. For more information, see the RDS Optimized Writes for MARIADB documentation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge the above is more of a warning than an error, but it always coincides with the imminent DB Instance restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the content of mysql-error-running.log. (The most recent incident anyway - the instance has been restarting now for a couple days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;250213 4:01:07 [ERROR] mysqld got signal 11 ;
Sorry, we probably made a mistake, and this is a bug.
Your assistance in bug reporting will enable us to fix this for the next release.
To report this bug, see &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs&lt;/a&gt;
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed,
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.
Server version: 10.6.18-MariaDB-log source revision:
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=3
max_threads=1313
thread_count=3
It is possible that mysqld could use up to
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 3074192 K bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.
Thread pointer: 0x400048296758
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...

&lt;p&gt;I can't see any InnoDB crash recovery bug fixes in the last release notes. There are a couple of crash prevention fixes however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't tell what version you mean by 10.11.44 (10.11.4? or 11.4 something?), however in general, 10.6 is a maintained version so sticking with that series will get all bug fixes. A newer version might avoid the bug if it was 10.6 only, but this is just speculation. Create a bug report, especially if producible in the latest 10.6.20 RDS version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/kb/en/innodb-recovery-modes/"&gt;InnoDB Recovery Modes&lt;/a&gt; has options for limiting crash recovery (which will loose potential data).&lt;/p&gt;
