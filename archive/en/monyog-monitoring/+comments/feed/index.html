&lt;p&gt;If a transaction in InnoDB has acquired a lock on a row or table then the query which has acquired the lock is called Locking query . MONyog gathers the information about locked queries, locking queries and locked tables from various innodb tables in information_schema like innodb_trx, innodb_locks, innodb_lock_waits ( these values are only related to InnoDB transactions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the value for locking queries you have to start the Real-Time feature of MONyog, there you can see the time information of locked queries, locked tables and locking queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enable deadlock monitoring, by just selecting "Yes" for the option "Enable deadlock monitoring?" (Edit server -&amp;gt; Advanced settings -&amp;gt; Deadlock) and MONyog will start tracing deadlocks. Once you have enabled, you can get the information from the group "InnoDB Deadlocks" having counters "New deadlock detected" and "Latest detected deadlock". "New deadlock detected" tells if a new deadlock was reported by "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS" between the last two data retrievals and "last deadlock detected" shows information about the last deadlock detected (if any). These two counters are alertable by default, you just need to enable mail alerts and you will be notified in the occurrence of such events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can monitor the error logs, general log and slow_query log file in MONyog and you can also refer our documentation for the same, here &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://monyogkb.webyog.com/article/29-advanced-settings"&gt;http://monyogkb.webyog.com/article/29-advanced-settings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://monyogkb.webyog.com/article/60-different-types-of-logs-supported"&gt;http://monyogkb.webyog.com/article/60-different-types-of-logs-supported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is currently not possible to monitor the binary logs in MONyog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may write to support@webyog.com if you have any queries in MONyog. Sibin (Webyog)&lt;/p&gt;
