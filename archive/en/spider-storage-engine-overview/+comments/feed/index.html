The behavior you observe must be caused by something else.&lt;/p&gt;

My assumption was no but I have an on-prem server running 10.2.8 with spider engine installed and I"m trying to connect to tables on an AWS RDS server running 10.1.23 with no spider engine installed.  attempts to query the spider table just never complete, no errors or anything.   Entries in mysql.spider_tables look fine...  spider table connections back to localhost work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
