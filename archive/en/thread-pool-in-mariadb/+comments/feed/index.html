It is also good idea to run sysbench and mysqld on different NUMA nodes, if possible."
mysqld should be replaced with mariadbd I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

For transactional workloads should be on par or better. One of the features I that did not excite me in Percona's implementation is "low priority connection throttling", as this seems a little dangerous optimization with potential for deadlocks, so this is not there in MariaDB. I also think thread_pool_kickup_timer is more reliable mechanism to avoid stalling low priority threads as compared to Percona's "tickets".&lt;/p&gt;

If it's something that interests you, I suggest &lt;a href="/kb/en/reporting-bugs/"&gt;adding it as a feature request on JIRA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
