With LIMIT the server is forced to do the ORDER BY as it has to discard possible rows from the end.&lt;/p&gt;

See (&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/why-is-order-by-in-a-from-subquery-ignored/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/why-is-order-by-in-a-from-subquery-ignored/&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it would be nice if there were a run time variable or SQL_MODE that allowed for the previous behavior. This will cost us a fair amount of code change and may scuttle the migration all together.&lt;/p&gt;
