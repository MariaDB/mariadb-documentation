The only pinning I had was mysql-common to origin ftp.osuosl.org as this package was conflicting with dotdeb.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done quite a bit more research and found that libmysqlclient18 was conflicting with dotdeb.org as well.  I don't know why these conflicts are happening with dotdeb.org and I don't know enough about apt to begin to hazard a guess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up trying to install on a fresh install of debian and got it to work there but I could not install it using mariadb-server.  I had to specify mariadb-server-5.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on my production server, I removed the package mariadb-server and pinned the mariadb repository higher than dotdeb and was able to upgrade to 5.5 without a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

I think you need to let it know to update the trees as well. Did you do any package pinning?&lt;/p&gt;
