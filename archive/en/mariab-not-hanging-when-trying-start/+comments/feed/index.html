It was indeed out of memory because of multiple instances running. Now it is up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the "128M" is showing "Cannot allocate memory" which is because memory isn't available. This is likely because an existing mariadb instance is still running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why its stopping are going to be earlier in the log file, before where the mariadb instance is restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given two instance cannot allocate 2x128M of innodb buffer pool it might be you are running out of ram on the failure. Look at `dmesg` output on your ec2 instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MariaDB-10.2.10 is coming up to 3 years old and between then and the currently 10.2.32 version there are a significant number of bug fixes, one of which might be causing your crash.&lt;/p&gt;
