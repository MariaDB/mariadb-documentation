If you find something that isn't working and isn't in the known-limitations write a bug report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are there any additional restrictions imposed by Galera?&lt;/p&gt;

Triggers - yes - executed on connected node and that row based replication means they aren't executed on slave (&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/trigger-limitations/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/trigger-limitations/&lt;/a&gt; ). However like anything that isn't explicitly documented as a limitation - try and see.&lt;/p&gt;
