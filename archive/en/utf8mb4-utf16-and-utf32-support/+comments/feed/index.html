&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5&lt;/a&gt; is stable since April 2012 and it has those character sets.&lt;/p&gt;

It's dependent on how quickly we can finish and release a stable version of &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/"&gt;MariaDB 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, so I can't be more specific than that at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, would you consider maybe just backporting utf8mb4? thats really the only character set I'm interested in and I suspect that  most anyone else would be interested in as well.&lt;/p&gt;
