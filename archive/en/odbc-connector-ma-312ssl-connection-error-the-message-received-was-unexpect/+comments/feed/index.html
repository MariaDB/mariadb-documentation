But this time I remembered:
on the Linux Server I had in the config:
[mysqld]
ssl-cipher = TLSv1.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I comment this out, it works on both mysql client and ODBC Connector on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my guess is a TLSv1.2 incompatibility between SChannel and openssl.&lt;/p&gt;
