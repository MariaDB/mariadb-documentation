All I know, really, is that years ago someone asked when it would be fixed, and someone from the project said not any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you've had good luck with it then I'll go ahead with fingers crossed.  Have you used large sequences?  Mine won't push the 2-byte limit, but some will hit 50 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I don't find that they're more trouble than they're worth :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used ENUM in both MySQL and MariaDB, and have noticed no brokenness. But perhaps I just didn't hit your particular test case.&lt;/p&gt;
