&lt;p&gt;mysql -uroot -f &amp;lt; mysql_system_tables_fix.sql syntax didn't work. I got some progress after modifying the command to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mysql -uroot -p -f &amp;lt; mysql_system_tables_fix.sql&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, I suspect may not have the correct mysql_system_tables_fix.sql file as I got a bunch of ERROR 1064 (42000) errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a copy of mysql_system_tables_fix.sql at &lt;a href="https://github.com/twitter/mysql/blob/master/scripts/mysql_system_tables_fix.sql"&gt;https://github.com/twitter/mysql/blob/master/scripts/mysql_system_tables_fix.sql&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to be for 5.5.40; would the difference between this and 5.5.44.002 make a significant difference? Where else can I for mysql_system_tables_fix.sql files?&lt;/p&gt;

So, I said that if you don't have &lt;code&gt;mysql_upgrade&lt;/code&gt; you can run this set of commands manually, using the mysql command-line client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done a search for "uroot" and "mysql_system_tables_fix.sql" in an attempt to gain some understanding around what is going on. I was unable to find anything at the MySQL website and a web search for "mysql_system_tables_fix" for &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-5544-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 5.5.44&lt;/a&gt; just got me confused  with the GitHubs, bugs.debians and dev.mysqls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How safe is using one of the files from these websites? Do I have to use a "mysql_system_tables_fix" that is built specifically for version 5.5.44.002 or will 5.5.44 or even 5.5 suffice? Can you suggest a safe website where I can download the file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for helping a complete beginner!&lt;/p&gt;
