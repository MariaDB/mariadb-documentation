This document provides a short overview of the **readwritesplit** router module
and its intended use case scenarios. It also displays all router configuration
parameters with their descriptions. A list of current limitations of the module
is included and use examples are provided.

[TOC]

## Overview

The **readwritesplit** router is designed to increase the read-only processing
capability of a cluster while maintaining consistency. This is achieved by
splitting the query load into read and write queries. Read queries, which do not
modify data, are spread across multiple nodes while all write queries will be
sent to a single node.

The router is designed to be used with a traditional Master-Slave replication
cluster. It automatically detects changes in the master server and will use the
current master server of the cluster. With a Galera cluster, one can achieve a
resilient setup and easy master failover by using one of the Galera nodes as a
Write-Master node, where all write queries are routed, and spreading the read
load over all the nodes.

## Interaction with servers in `Maintenance` and `Draining` state

When a server that readwritesplit uses is put into maintenance mode, any ongoing
requests are allowed to finish before the connection is closed. If the server
that is put into maintenance mode is a master, open transaction are allowed to
complete before the connection is closed. Note that this means neither idle
session nor long-running transactions will be closed by readwritesplit. To
forcefully close the connections, use the following command:

```
maxctrl set server &lt;server&gt; maintenance --force
```

If a server is put into the `Draining` state while a connection is open, the
connection will be used normally. Whenever a new connection needs to be created,
whether that be due to a network error or when a new session being opened, only
servers that are neither `Draining` nor `Drained` will be used.

## Configuration

Readwritesplit router-specific settings are specified in the configuration file
of MariaDB MaxScale in its specific section. The section can be freely named but
the name is used later as a reference in a listener section.

For more details about the standard service parameters, refer to the
[Configuration Guide](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide).

Starting with 2.3, all router parameters can be configured at runtime. Use
`maxctrl alter service` to modify them. The changed configuration will only be
taken into use by new sessions.

## Parameters

### `max_slave_connections`

**`max_slave_connections`** sets the maximum number of slaves a router session
uses at any moment. The default is to use at most 255 slave connections per
client connection. In older versions the default was to use all available slaves
with no limit.

```
max_slave_connections=&lt;max. number, or % of available slaves&gt;
```

For example, if you have configured MaxScale with one master and three slaves
and set `max_slave_connections=2`, for each client connection a connection to
the master and two slave connections would be opened. The read query load
balancing is then done between these two slaves and writes are sent to the
master.

By tuning this parameter, you can control how dynamic the load balancing is at
the cost of extra created connections. With a lower value of
`max_slave_connections`, less connections per session are created and the set of
possible slave servers is smaller. With a higher value in
`max_slave_connections`, more connections are created which requires more
resources but load balancing will almost always give the best single query
response time and performance. Longer sessions are less affected by a high
`max_slave_connections` as the relative cost of opening a connection is lower.

### `max_slave_replication_lag`

**`max_slave_replication_lag`** specifies how many seconds a slave is allowed to
be behind the master. If the lag is bigger than the configured value a slave
can&#39;t be used for routing.

This feature is disabled by default.

	max_slave_replication_lag=&lt;allowed lag&gt;

The lag is specified as documented
[here](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the lag is seconds, a lag specified in milliseconds will be rejected, even if
the duration is longer than a second.

The Readwritesplit-router does not detect the replication lag itself. A monitor
such as the MariaDB-monitor for a Master/Slave-cluster is required. This option
only affects Master-Slave clusters. Galera clusters do not have a concept of
slave lag even if the application of write sets might have lag. When a server is
disqualified from routing because of replication lag, a warning is logged. Similarly,
when the server has caught up enough to be a valid routing target, another warning
is logged. These messages are only logged when a query is being routed and the
replication state changes.

### `use_sql_variables_in`

**`use_sql_variables_in`** specifies where should queries, which read session
variable, be routed. The syntax for `use_sql_variable_in` is:

    use_sql_variables_in=[master|all]

The default is to use SQL variables in all servers.

When value `all` is used, queries reading session variables can be routed to any
available slave (depending on selection criteria). Queries modifying session
variables are routed to all backend servers by default, excluding write queries
with embedded session variable modifications, such as:

    INSERT INTO test.t1 VALUES (@myid:=@myid+1)

In above-mentioned case the user-defined variable would only be updated in the
master where the query would be routed to due to the `INSERT` statement.

```
[Splitter-Service]
type=service
router=readwritesplit
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3
user=maxscale
password=96F99AA1315BDC3604B006F427DD9484
disable_sescmd_history=true
master_failure_mode=fail_on_write
```

### `connection_keepalive`

Send keepalive pings to backend servers. This feature was introduced in MaxScale
2.2.0. The default value is 300 seconds starting with 2.3.2 and for older
versions the feature was disabled by default.

The keepalive is specified as documented
[here](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the keepalive is seconds, a keepalive specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

The parameter value is the interval in seconds between each keepalive ping. A
keepalive ping will be sent to a backend server if the connection is idle and it
has not been used within `n` seconds where `n` is greater than or equal to the
value of _connection_keepalive_. The keepalive pings are only sent when the
client executes a query.

This functionality allows the readwritesplit module to keep all backend
connections alive even if they are not used. This is a common problem if the
backend servers have a low _wait_timeout_ value and the client connections live
for a long time or if your workload is extremely read-heavy with writes done at
lower intervals than the configured _wait_timeout_.

### `master_reconnection`

Allow the master server to change mid-session. This feature was introduced in
MaxScale 2.3.0 and is disabled by default.

When a readwritesplit session starts, it will pick a master server as the
current master server of that session. By default, when this master server
changes mid-session, the connection will be closed.

If the `master_reconnection` parameter is enabled, the master server is allowed
to change as long as the session meets the following criteria:

* The session is already connected to the slave that was chosen to be the new master
* No transaction is open
* Autocommit is enabled
* No `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` is in progress
* There are no queries being actively routed to the old master

When `master_reconnection` is enabled in conjunction with either
`master_failure_mode=fail_on_write` or `master_failure_mode=error_on_write`, the
session can recover from the loss of a master server. This means that when a
session starts without a master server and later a slave server that it is
connected to is promoted as the master, the session will come out of the
read-only mode (described in detail in the
[`master_failure_mode`](#master_failure_mode) documentation).

### `slave_selection_criteria`

This option controls how the readwritesplit router chooses the slaves it
connects to and how the load balancing is done. The default behavior is to route
read queries to the slave server with the lowest amount of ongoing queries i.e.
`LEAST_CURRENT_OPERATIONS`.

The option syntax:

```
slave_selection_criteria=&lt;criteria&gt;
```

Where `&lt;criteria&gt;` is one of the following values.

* `LEAST_GLOBAL_CONNECTIONS`, the slave with least connections from MariaDB MaxScale
* `LEAST_ROUTER_CONNECTIONS`, the slave with least connections from this service
* `LEAST_BEHIND_MASTER`, the slave with smallest replication lag
* `LEAST_CURRENT_OPERATIONS` (default), the slave with least active operations
* `ADAPTIVE_ROUTING`, based on server average response times. See below.

The `LEAST_GLOBAL_CONNECTIONS` and `LEAST_ROUTER_CONNECTIONS` use the
connections from MariaDB MaxScale to the server, not the amount of connections
reported by the server itself.

`LEAST_BEHIND_MASTER` and `ADAPTIVE_ROUTING` do not take server weights into account
when choosing a server.

`ADAPTIVE_ROUTING` Measures average server response times. The server averages
are used as proxies of server load conditions. At selection time the averages
are copied and modified to favor faster servers, while at the same time
guaranteeing at lest some traffic to the slowest servers. The server selection
is probabilistic based on roulette wheel selection.

#### Server Weights and `slave_selection_criteria`

NOTE: Server Weights have been deprecated in MaxScale 2.3 and will be removed
at a later time.

The following formula is used to calculate a score for a server when the
`weightby` parameter is defined.

```
score = x / w
```

`x` is the absolute value of the chosen metric (queries, connections) and
`w` is the weight of the server. The value of `w` is the relative weight
of the server in relation to all the servers configured for the
service. The server with the highest score that fulfills all other
criteria is chosen as the target server.

Read the [configuration guide](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#weightby)
for a more detailed example on how the weights are calculated.

For `LEAST_CURRENT_OPERATIONS`, the metric is number of active queries on
the candidate server, for `LEAST_GLOBAL_CONNECTIONS` and
`LEAST_ROUTER_CONNECTIONS` it is the number of open connections and for
`LEAST_BEHIND_MASTER` it is the number of seconds a server is behind the
master.

#### Interaction Between `slave_selection_criteria` and `max_slave_connections`

Depending on the value of `max_slave_connections`, the slave selection criteria
behave in different ways. Here are a few example cases of how the different
criteria work with different amounts of slave connections.

* With `slave_selection_criteria=LEAST_GLOBAL_CONNECTIONS` and
`max_slave_connections=1`, each session picks one slave and one master

* With `slave_selection_criteria=LEAST_CURRENT_OPERATIONS` and
`max_slave_connections=100%`, each session picks one master and as many slaves
as possible

* With `slave_selection_criteria=LEAST_CURRENT_OPERATIONS` each read is load
balanced based on how many queries are active on a particular slave

* With `slave_selection_criteria=LEAST_GLOBAL_CONNECTIONS` each read is sent to
the slave with the least amount of connections

### `max_sescmd_history`

**`max_sescmd_history`** sets a limit on how many distinct session commands each
session can execute before the session command history is disabled. The default
is 50 session commands starting with MaxScale 2.3.0. In older versions, the
session command history was disabled by default.

```
# Set a limit on the session command history
max_sescmd_history=1500
```

When a session command is executed for the first time, it is stored in
memory. Any subsequent executions of the same command are stored as references
to the original command. By storing references instead of copies of the data,
the amount of memory used is reduced.

If you have long-running sessions which change the session state often, increase
the value of this parameter if server reconnections fail due to disabled session
command history.

When a limitation is set, it effectively creates a cap on the session&#39;s memory
consumption. This might be useful if connection pooling is used and the sessions
use large amounts of session commands.

### `disable_sescmd_history`

This option disables the session command history. This way no history is stored
and if a slave server fails, the router will not try to replace the failed
slave. Disabling session command history will allow long-lived connections
without causing a constant growth in the memory consumption.

This option is only intended to be enabled if the value of
`max_slave_connections` is lowered below the default value. This will allow a
failed slave to be replaced with a standby slave server.

In versions 2.0 and older, the session command history is enabled by default.
In version 2.1 and 2.2, the session command history is disabled by default.  In
2.3 and newer versions, the session command is enabled but it is limited to a
default of 50 session commands after which the history is disabled.

```
# Disable the session command history
disable_sescmd_history=true
```

### `prune_sescmd_history`

This option prunes the session command history when it exceeds the value
configured in `max_sescmd_history`. When this option is enabled, only a set
number of statements are stored in the history. This limits the per-session
memory use while still allowing safe reconnections. This parameter was added in
MaxScale 2.3.4 and is disabled by default.

This parameter is intended to be used with pooled connections that remain in use
for a very long time. Most connection pool implementations do not reset the
session state and instead re-initialize it with new values. This causes the
session command history to grow at roughly a constant rate for the lifetime of
the pooled connection.

Each client-side session that uses a pooled connection only executes a finite
amount of session commands. By retaining a shorter history that encompasses all
session commands the individual clients execute, the session state of a pooled
connection can be accurately recreated on another server.

If the session command history pruning is enabled, there is a theoretical
possibility that upon server reconnection the session states of the connections
are inconsistent. This can only happen if the length of the stored history is
shorter than the list of relevant statements that affect the session state. In
practice the default value of 50 session commands is a fairly reasonable value
and the risk of inconsistent session state is relatively low.

In case the default history length is too short for safe pruning, set the value
of `max_sescmd_history` to the total number of commands that affect the session
state plus a safety margin of 10. The safety margin reserves some extra space
for new commands that might be executed due to changes in the client side
application.

### `master_accept_reads`

**`master_accept_reads`** allows the master server to be used for reads. This is
a useful option to enable if you are using a small number of servers and wish to
use the master for reads as well.

By default, no reads are sent to the master as long as there is a valid slave
server available. If no slaves are available, reads are sent to the master
regardless of the value of `master_accept_reads`.

```
# Use the master for reads
master_accept_reads=true
```

### `strict_multi_stmt`

This option is disabled by default since MaxScale 2.2.1. In older versions, this
option was enabled by default.

When a client executes a multi-statement query, it will be treated as if it were
a DML statement and routed to the master. If the option is enabled, all queries
after a multi-statement query will be routed to the master to guarantee a
consistent session state.

If the feature is disabled, queries are routed normally after a multi-statement
query.

**Warning:** Enable the strict mode only if you know that the clients will send
  statements that cause inconsistencies in the session state.

```
# Enable strict multi-statement mode
strict_multi_stmt=true
```

### `strict_sp_calls`

Similar to `strict_multi_stmt`, this option allows all queries after a CALL
operation on a stored procedure to be routed to the master. This option is
disabled by default and was added in MaxScale 2.1.9.

All warnings and restrictions that apply to `strict_multi_stmt` also apply to
`strict_sp_calls`.

### `master_failure_mode`

This option controls how the failure of a master server is handled. By default,
the router will close the client connection as soon as the master is lost.

The following table describes the values for this option and how they treat the
loss of a master server.

| Value        | Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|fail_instantly | When the failure of the master server is detected, the connection will be closed immediately.|
|fail_on_write | The client connection is closed if a write query is received when no master is available.|
|error_on_write | If no master is available and a write query is received, an error is returned stating that the connection is in read-only mode.|

These also apply to new sessions created after the master has failed. This means
that in `fail_on_write` or `error_on_write` mode, connections are accepted as
long as slave servers are available.

When configured with `fail_on_write` or `error_on_write`, sessions that are idle
will not be closed even if all backend connections for that session have
failed. This is done in the hopes that before the next query from the idle
session arrives, a reconnection to one of the slaves is made. However, this can
leave idle connections around unless the client application actively closes
them. To prevent this, use the
[connection_timeout](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#connection_timeout)
parameter.

**Note:** If `master_failure_mode` is set to `error_on_write` and the connection
to the master is lost, by default, clients will not be able to execute write
queries without reconnecting to MariaDB MaxScale once a new master is
available. If [`master_reconnection`](#master_reconnection) is enabled, the
session can recover if one of the slaves is promoted as the master.

### `retry_failed_reads`

This option controls whether autocommit selects are retried in case of failure.
This option is enabled by default.

When a simple autocommit select is being executed outside of a transaction and
the slave server where the query is being executed fails, readwritesplit can
retry the read on a replacement server. This makes the failure of a slave
transparent to the client.

### `delayed_retry`

Retry queries over a period of time. This parameter takes a boolean value, was
added in Maxscale 2.3.0 and is disabled by default.

When this feature is enabled, a failure to route a query due to a connection
problem will not immediately result in an error. The routing of the query is
delayed until either a valid candidate server is available or the retry timeout
is reached. If a candidate server becomes available before the timeout is
reached, the query is routed normally and no connection error is returned. If no
candidates are found and the timeout is exceeded, the router returns to normal
behavior and returns an error.

When combined with the `master_reconnection` parameter, failures of writes done
outside of transactions can be hidden from the client connection. This allows a
master to be replaced while a write is in progress.

The delayed query retrying mode in readwritesplit does not do any sort of
duplicate write detection. To prevent accidental data duplication, it is highly
recommended to tune the monitor timeouts to values that produce accurate
results.

Duplicate execution of a statement can occur if the connection to the server is
lost or the server crashes but the server comes back up before the timeout for
the retrying is exceeded. At this point, if the server managed to read the
client&#39;s statement, it will be executed. For this reason, it is recommended to
only enable `delayed_retry` when the possibility of duplicate statement
execution is an acceptable risk.

### `delayed_retry_timeout`

The duration to wait until an error is returned to the client when
`delayed_retry` is enabled. The default value is 10 seconds.

The timeout is specified as documented
[here](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `transaction_replay`

Replay interrupted transactions. This parameter was added in MaxScale 2.3.0 and
is disabled by default. Enabling this parameter enables both `delayed_retry` and
`master_reconnection` and sets `master_failure_mode` to `fail_on_write`, thereby
overriding any configured values for these parameters.

When the server where the transaction is in progress fails, readwritesplit can
migrate the transaction to a replacement server. This can completely hide the
failure of a master node without any visible effects to the client.

If no replacement node becomes available before the timeout controlled by
`delayed_retry_timeout` is exceeded, the client connection is closed.

### `transaction_replay_max_size`

The limit on transaction size for transaction replay in bytes. Any transaction
that exceeds this limit will not be replayed. The default value is 1 MiB. This
limit applies at a session level which means that the total peak memory
consumption can be `transaction_replay_max_size` times the number of client
connections.

The amount of memory needed to store a particular transaction will be slightly
larger than the length in bytes of the SQL used in the transaction. If the limit
is ever exceeded, a message will be logged at the info level.

Read [the configuration guide](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#sizes)
for more details on size type parameters in MaxScale.

### `transaction_replay_attempts`

The upper limit on how many times a transaction replay is attempted before
giving up. The default value is 5.

A transaction replay failure can happen if the server where the transaction is
being replayed fails while the replay is in progress. In practice this parameter
controls how many server and network failures a single transaction replay
tolerates. If a transaction is replayed successfully, the counter for failed
attempts is reset.

### `transaction_replay_retry_on_deadlock`

Enable automatic retrying of transactions that end up in a deadlock. This
parameter was added in MaxScale 2.4.6 and the feature is disabled by
default. MaxScale versions from 2.4.0 to 2.4.5 always tried to replay deadlocked
transactions.

If this feature is enabled and a transaction returns a deadlock error
(e.g. `SQLSTATE 40001: Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction`),
the transaction is automatically retried. If the retrying of the transaction
results in another deadlock error, it is retried until it either succeeds or a
transaction checksum error is encountered.

### `optimistic_trx`

Enable optimistic transaction execution. This parameter controls whether normal
transactions (i.e. `START TRANSACTION` or `BEGIN`) are load balanced across
slaves. This feature is disabled by default and enabling it implicitly enables
`transaction_replay`, `delayed_retry` and `master_reconnection` parameters.

When this mode is enabled, all transactions are first attempted on slave
servers. If the transaction contains no statements that modify data, it is
completed on the slave. If the transaction contains statements that modify data,
it is rolled back on the slave server and restarted on the master. The rollback
is initiated the moment a data modifying statement is intercepted by
readwritesplit so only read-only statements are executed on slave servers.

As with `transaction_replay` and transactions that are replayed, if the results
returned by the master server are not identical to the ones returned by the
slave up to the point where the first data modifying statement was executed, the
connection is closed. If the execution of ROLLBACK statement on the slave fails,
the connection to that slave is closed.

All limitations that apply to `transaction_replay` also apply to
`optimistic_trx`.

### `causal_reads`

Enable causal reads. This parameter is disabled by default and was introduced in
MaxScale 2.3.0.

If a client connection modifies the database and `causal_reads` is enabled, any
subsequent reads performed on slave servers will be done in a manner that
prevents replication lag from affecting the results. This only applies to the
modifications done by the client itself.

**Note:** This feature requires MariaDB 10.2.16 or newer to function. In
  addition to this, the `session_track_system_variables` parameter must be set
  to `last_gtid`.

**Note:** This feature does not work with prepared statements. Only SQL
  statements executed individually (inside a COM_QUERY packet) can be handled by
  the causal read mechanism.

**Note:** This feature does not work with Galera or any other non-standard
  replication mechanisms. As Galera does not update the `gtid_slave_pos`
  variable when events are replicated via the Galera library, the
  [`MASTER_GTID_WAIT`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/master_gtid_wait/)
  function used by MaxScale to synchronize reads will wait until the
  timeout. With Galera this is not a serious issue as it, by nature, is a
  mostly-synchronous replication mechanism.

A practical example can be given by the following set of SQL commands executed
with `autocommit=1`.

```sql
INSERT INTO test.t1 (id) VALUES (1);
SELECT * FROM test.t1 WHERE id = 1;
```

As the statements are not executed inside a transaction, from the load balancers
point of view, the latter statement can be routed to a slave server. The problem
with this is that if the value that was inserted on the master has not yet
replicated to the server where the SELECT statement is being performed, it can
appear as if the value we just inserted is not there.

By prefixing these types of SELECT statements with a command that guarantees
consistent results for the reads, read scalability can be improved without
sacrificing consistency.

The set of example SQL above will be translated by MaxScale into the following
statements.

```sql
INSERT INTO test.t1 (id) VALUES (1);
SET @maxscale_secret_variable=(
    SELECT CASE
           WHEN MASTER_GTID_WAIT(&#39;0-3000-8&#39;, 10) = 0 THEN 1
           ELSE (SELECT 1 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ENGINES)
    END);
SELECT * FROM test.t1 WHERE id = 1;
```

The `SET` command will synchronize the slave to a certain logical point in
the replication stream (see
[MASTER_GTID_WAIT](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/master_gtid_wait/)
for more details).

If the slave has not caught up to the master within the configured time, it will
be retried on the master. In MaxScale 2.3.0 an error was returned to the client
when the slave timed out.

### `causal_reads_timeout`

The timeout for the slave synchronization done by `causal_reads`. The
default value is 10 seconds.

The timeout is specified as documented
[here](node:mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `lazy_connect`

Lazy connection creation causes connections to backend servers to be opened only
when they are needed. This reduces the load that is placed on the backend
servers when the client connections are short. This parameter is a boolean type
and is disabled by default.

By default readwritesplit opens as many connections as it can when the session
is first opened. This makes the execution of the first query faster when all
available connections are already created. When `lazy_connect` is enabled, this
initial connection creation is skipped. If the client executes only read
queries, no connection to the master is made. If only write queries are made,
only the master connection is used.

## Router Diagnostics

The `router_diagnostics` output for a readwritesplit service contains the
following fields.

* `queries`: Number of queries executed through this service.
* `route_master`: Number of writes routed to master.
* `route_slave`: Number of reads routed to slaves.
* `route_all`: Number of session commands routed to all servers.
* `rw_transactions`: Number of explicit read-write transactions.
* `ro_transactions`: Number of explicit read-only transactions.
* `replayed_transactions`: Number of replayed transactions.

* `server_query_statistics`: Statistics for each configured and used server consisting of the following fields.
  * `id`: Name of the server
  * `total`: Total number of queries.
  * `read`: Total number of reads.
  * `write`: Total number of writes.
  * `avg_sess_duration`: Average duration of a client session to this server.
  * `avg_sess_active_pct`: Average percentage of time client sessions were active. 0% means connections were opened but never used.
  * `avg_selects_per_session`: Average number of selects per session.

## Server Ranks

The general rule with server ranks is that primary servers will be used before
secondary servers. Readwritesplit is an exception to this rule. The following
rules govern how readwritesplit behaves with servers that have different ranks.

* Sessions will use the current master server as long as possible. This means
  that sessions with a secondary master will not use the primary master as long
  as the secondary master is available.

* All slave connections will use the same rank as the master connection. Any
  stale connections with a different rank than the master will be discarded.

* If no master connection is available and `master_reconnection` is enabled, a
  connection to the best master is created. If the new master has a different
  priority than existing connections have, the connections with a different rank
  will be discarded.

* If open connections exist, these will be used for routing. This means that if
  the master is lost but the session still has slave servers with the same rank,
  they will remain in use.

* If no open connections exist, the servers with the best rank will used.


## Routing hints

The readwritesplit router supports routing hints. For a detailed guide on hint
syntax and functionality, please read [this](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-hint-syntax)
document.

**Note**: Routing hints will always have the highest priority when a routing
decision is made. This means that it is possible to cause inconsistencies in
the session state and the actual data in the database by adding routing hints
to DDL/DML statements which are then directed to slave servers. Only use routing
hints when you are sure that they can cause no harm.

## Examples

Examples of the readwritesplit router in use can be found in the
[Tutorials](../Tutorials) folder.

## Readwritesplit routing decisions

Here is a small explanation which shows what kinds of queries are routed to
which type of server.

### Routing to Master

Routing to master is important for data consistency and because majority of
writes are written to binlog and thus become replicated to slaves.

The following operations are routed to master:

* write statements,
* all statements within an open transaction,
* stored procedure calls
* user-defined function calls
* DDL statements (`DROP`|`CREATE`|`ALTER TABLE` … etc.)
* `EXECUTE` (prepared) statements that modify the database
* all statements using temporary tables

In addition to these, if the **readwritesplit** service is configured with the
`max_slave_replication_lag` parameter, and if all slaves suffer from too much
replication lag, then statements will be routed to the _Master_. (There might be
other similar configuration parameters in the future which limit the number of
statements that will be routed to slaves.)

### Routing to Slaves

The ability to route some statements to slaves is important because it also
decreases the load targeted to master. Moreover, it is possible to have multiple
slaves to share the load in contrast to single master.

Queries which can be routed to slaves must be auto committed and belong to one
of the following group:

* read-only database queries,
* read-only queries to system, or user-defined variables,
* `SHOW` statements
* system function calls.

### Routing to every session backend

A third class of statements includes those which modify session data, such as
session system variables, user-defined variables, the default database, etc. We
call them session commands, and they must be replicated as they affect the
future results of read and write operations. They must be executed on all
servers that could execute statements on behalf of this client.

Session commands include for example:

* `SET` statements
* `USE `*`&lt;dbname&gt;`*
* system/user-defined variable assignments embedded in read-only statements, such
as `SELECT (@myvar := 5)`
* `PREPARE` statements
* `QUIT`, `PING`, `STMT RESET`, `CHANGE USER`, etc. commands

**NOTE**: if variable assignment is embedded in a write statement it is routed
to _Master_ only. For example, `INSERT INTO t1 values(@myvar:=5, 7)` would be
routed to _Master_ only.

The router stores all of the executed session commands so that in case of a
slave failure, a replacement slave can be chosen and the session command history
can be repeated on that new slave. This means that the router stores each
executed session command for the duration of the session. Applications that use
long-running sessions might cause MariaDB MaxScale to consume a growing amount
of memory unless the sessions are closed. This can be solved by adjusting the
value of `max_sescmd_history`.

### Routing to previous target

In the following cases, a query is routed to the same server where the previous
query was executed. If no previous target is found, the query is routed to the
current master.

* If a query uses the `FOUND_ROWS()` function, it will be routed to the server
  where the last query was executed. This is done with the assumption that a
  query with `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS` was previously executed.

* COM_STMT_FETCH_ROWS will always be routed to the same server where the
  COM_STMT_EXECUTE was routed.

## Limitations

Read queries are routed to the master server in the following situations:

* query is executed inside an open transaction
* statement includes a stored procedure or an UDF call
* if there are multiple statements inside one query e.g.
  `INSERT INTO ... ; SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();`

### Prepares Statement Limitations

If a prepared statement targets a temporary table on the master, the slave
servers will fail to execute it. This will cause all slave connections to be
closed (MXS-1816).

### Transaction Replay Limitations

If the results from the replacement server are not identical when the
transaction is replayed, the client connection is closed. This means that any
transaction with a server specific result (e.g. `NOW()`, `@@server_id`) cannot
be replayed successfully but it will still be attempted.

Any changes to the session state (e.g. autocommit state, SQL mode) done inside a
transaction will remain in effect even if the connection to the server where the
transaction is being executed fails. When readwritesplit creates a new
connection to a server to replay the transaction, it will first restore the
session state by executing all session commands that were executed. This means
that if the session state is changed mid-transaction in a way that affects the
results, transaction replay will fail.

The following partial transaction demonstrates the problem by using
[`SQL_MODE`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/sql-mode/) inside a transaction.

```
SET SQL_MODE=&#39;&#39;;            -- A session command
BEGIN;
SELECT &#34;hello world&#34;;       -- Returns the string &#34;hello world&#34;
SET SQL_MODE=&#39;ANSI_QUOTES&#39;; -- A session command
SELECT &#39;hello world&#39;;       -- Returns the string &#34;hello world&#34;
```

If this transaction has to be replayed the actual SQL that gets executed is the
following.

```
SET SQL_MODE=&#39;&#39;;            -- Replayed session command
SET SQL_MODE=&#39;ANSI_QUOTES&#39;; -- Replayed session command
BEGIN;
SELECT &#34;hello world&#34;;       -- Returns an error
SELECT &#39;hello world&#39;;       -- Returns the string &#34;hello world&#34;
```

First the session state is restored by executing all commands that changed the
state after which the actual transaction is replayed. Due to the fact that the
SQL_MODE was changed mid-transaction, one of the queries will now return an
error instead of the result we expected leading to a transaction replay failure.

### Legacy Configuration

In older versions of MaxScale, routers were configured via the _router_options_
parameter. This functionality was deprecated in 2.2 and was removed in 2.3.

### JDBC Batched Statements

Readwritesplit does not support pipelining of JDBC batched statements. This is
caused by the fact that readwritesplit executes the statements one at a time to
track the state of the response.

#### Limitations in multi-statement handling

When a multi-statement query is executed through the readwritesplit router, it
will always be routed to the master. See
[`strict_multi_stmt`](node:mariadb-maxscale-24-readwritesplit#strict_multi_stmt) for more
details.

If the multi-statement query creates a temporary table, it will not be
detected and reads to this table can be routed to slave servers. To
prevent this, always execute the temporary table creation as an individual
statement.

#### Limitations in client session handling

Some of the queries that a client sends are routed to all backends instead of
just to one. These queries include `USE &lt;db name&gt;` and `SET autocommit=0`, among
many others. Readwritesplit sends a copy of these queries to each backend server
and forwards the master&#39;s reply to the client. Below is a list of MySQL commands
which are classified as session commands.

```
COM_INIT_DB (USE &lt;db name&gt; creates this)
COM_CHANGE_USER
COM_STMT_CLOSE
COM_STMT_SEND_LONG_DATA
COM_STMT_RESET
COM_STMT_PREPARE
COM_QUIT (no response, session is closed)
COM_REFRESH
COM_DEBUG
COM_PING
SQLCOM_CHANGE_DB (USE ... statements)
SQLCOM_DEALLOCATE_PREPARE
SQLCOM_PREPARE
SQLCOM_SET_OPTION
SELECT ..INTO variable|OUTFILE|DUMPFILE
SET autocommit=1|0
```

Prior to MaxScale 2.3.0, session commands that were 2²⁴ - 1 bytes or longer were
not supported and caused the session to be closed.

There is a possibility for misbehavior. If `USE mytable` is executed in one of
the slaves and fails, it may be due to replication lag rather than the database
not existing. Thus, the same command may produce different result in different
backend servers. The slaves which fail to execute a session command will be
dropped from the active list of slaves for this session to guarantee a
consistent session state across all the servers used by the session. In
addition, the server will not be used again for routing for the duration of the
session.

The above-mentioned behavior for user variables can be partially controlled with
the configuration parameter `use_sql_variables_in`:

```
use_sql_variables_in=[master|all] (default: all)
```

**WARNING**

If a SELECT query modifies a user variable when the `use_sql_variables_in`
parameter is set to `all`, it will not be routed and the client will receive an
error. A log message is written into the log further explaining the reason for
the error. Here is an example use of a SELECT query which modifies a user
variable and how MariaDB MaxScale responds to it.

```
MySQL [(none)]&gt; set @id=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MySQL [(none)]&gt; SELECT @id := @id + 1 FROM test.t1;
ERROR 1064 (42000): Routing query to backend failed. See the error log for further details.
```

Allow user variable modification in SELECT queries by setting
`use_sql_variables_in=master`. This will route all queries that use user
variables to the master.
