Most Windows versions are supported as well, and you can get several versions on macOS through brew &amp;amp; MacPorts that are pretty stable &amp;amp; run fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details from MariaDB.com on specific Linux versions can be found here: &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/deploy/os-compatibility/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/docs/deploy/os-compatibility/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Windows is quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mac OS is poorly supported -- don't go there.&lt;/p&gt;
