Some aren't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is naturally to include more and more features as time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its also important to note that Twitter MySQL engineer, Davi Arnaut, is also a "Maria Captain", which means he can also contribute to the tree. (see: &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~maria-captains/+members"&gt;https://launchpad.net/~maria-captains/+members&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTH&lt;/p&gt;
