&lt;p&gt;It seems that i had the wrong idea about the gpl and what constitutes a static link to code or maybe i just had the wrong idea completely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licences are such a minefield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again.  This gave me all the info i needed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that as the .net connector is not directly linked into your application, but rather through a net connector manager, the GPL in the .net connector will not affect your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the GPL .net library would affect your application, it should also affect the net connector manger. As the manager can never be used under GPL it would mean that no one could ever use the .net library.  The only way the .net connector could exist and be used is if there is an implicit agreement that the GPL code in the connector will not affect any other code than the connector itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, from a licensing point of view, there is no difference if the .net connector or .lgpl or .gpl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all the other LGPL connectors that have been developed for MySQL/MariaDB have been sponsored by one or a few companies. If you really would like to see a lgpl .net client, you should contact a provider like SkySQL to make arrangements to create one that would be freely available for all.&lt;/p&gt;
