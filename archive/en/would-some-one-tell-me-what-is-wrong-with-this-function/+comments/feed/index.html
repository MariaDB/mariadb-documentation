I guess that would do it!
Thanks!!!&lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, read up on what &lt;a href="/kb/en/create-function/"&gt;DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL and READS SQL DATA&lt;/a&gt; do and use one of them in your definition.&lt;/p&gt;

SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
now it's working fine !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now I'm getting this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERROR 1418: This function has none of DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL, or READS SQL DATA in its declaration and binary logging is enabled (you *might* want to use the less safe log_bin_trust_function_creators variable)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
