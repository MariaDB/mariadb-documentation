</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Renaud Michel</dc:creator><guid>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mirroring-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/+comments/3641</guid></item><item><title>Use httrack instead of wget</title><link>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mirroring-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/+comments/3640</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Httrack does a better job (because it is its purpose) than wget at creating a local mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem when mirroring the knowledge base, is that it makes heavy use or redirections, and wget will follow those redirections, and you end up with lots of duplicated pages. (I have even hit wget's limit of 20 redirections)
Httrack, on the other hand, will mirror the redirection by creating a small HTML file with a Refresh meta (effectively simulating the HTTP redirect), and will only download the page once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the login page.
That link doesn't show in the mirror, but it is actually present in a div.nav-top-mobile, and as web scrapers don't care about CSS, they will follow that link.
The big problem is that the login link contains the originating page as a parameter, so you end up downloading that login page once for each page.
So, the path /kb/user/ should always be excluded from mirroring.
With wget you can do it with the option --reject-regex /kb/user/
With httrack you can do it with the filter -kb-mirror.mariadb.com/kb/user/*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror layout should probably be fixed to remove that useless login link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are only interested in one language, limiting yourself to that path (/kb/en/ for english) will significantly reduce the number of pages (you will still need the content in /kb/static/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that, here is an httrack command line to mirror the knowledge base in english, in the local directory kb-mirror-en:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;httrack --mirror --path kb-mirror-en --sockets=2 --structure=100 --robots=0 &lt;a href="http://kb-mirror.mariadb.com/kb/en/"&gt;http://kb-mirror.mariadb.com/kb/en/&lt;/a&gt; +kb-mirror.mariadb.com/kb/static/\*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The --sockets=2 option is to avoid hammering the server with too much simultaneous connections (the default is 8), and the --structure=100 option will avoid creating a subdirectory with the hostname (useless as we are downloading only a single host).
(the --clean option may be useful too, if you don't want to use the update feature of httrack)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that (and limiting myself to english), I ended up with a mirror containing a little less than 10,000 files (with more than half being auto-generated redirection files) for a total size of "only" 230MiB.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"> </dc:creator><guid>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mirroring-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/+comments/3585</guid></item><item><title>Re: Mirroring the MariaDB Knowledge Base</title><link>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mirroring-the-mariadb-knowledge-base/+comments/3584</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Thx a lot. Now it works again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who needs an offline documentation, this is the unique methode as today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an idea what you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;approx. 22,000 files and folders with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;approx. 700 MB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me 6 1/2 hours with a 1Mbit/s connection, which never reached their limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a tar.gz it would be only 1 1/2 hours instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures are missing in the offline docu!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experiences and suggestions with the topic "offline documentation":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) If you try to find "offline documentation" over the search on the main page you    
    get "Your search yielded no results."
    &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/search/node?keys=offline%20documentation"&gt;https://mariadb.com/search/node?keys=offline%20documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I found first the following task while looking for a pdf version of the 
    documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6881"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6881&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    which easily bring me to this site.
    I think the topic "offline documentation" is easier to find for anyone if you have    
    an extra topic for that under &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/documentation/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/documentation/&lt;/a&gt;
    even as last listed, where this site is linked to or are the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) I would be happy, if some day a pdf-version is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) I would appreciate, if you could generate a tar.gz or/and zip file which is easier 
    and way more faster to download (in my case factor 4) including pictures.
    From server site this is easily to reach as a weekly or daily version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if there are only a few out who needs this, don't care. I'm satisfied with what I got now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an excellent documentation of an excellent software and this offline ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
