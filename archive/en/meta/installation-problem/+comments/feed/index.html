that you can create here &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What can be the reason" can only be answered with detailed information, like the one from the MSI log.&lt;/p&gt;

I had previously installed MySQL, but after the takeover by Oracle I had massive problems, so I wanted to try MariaDB now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the installation dies service "MariaDB" failed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I had previously uninstalled and deleted MySQL, but I have the impression that the installation process found something from MySQL
and is now looking for further components and cannot find them. I have admin rights, but the retry doesn't change anything.
What could be the reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much&lt;/p&gt;
