&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing not. You've probably logged in with an anonymous user that only has access to the mentioned database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to change your connection to use a user that has access to your other databases. You should also secure your installation if I'm correct. Here is a good start &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mysql_secure_installation/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mysql_secure_installation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
