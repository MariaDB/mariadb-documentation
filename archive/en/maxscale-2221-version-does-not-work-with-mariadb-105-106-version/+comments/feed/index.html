I have a license related question.&lt;br&gt;
On github, it is written as a change in 2024.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/blob/maxscale-2.3.20/LICENSE23.TXT"&gt;https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/blob/maxscale-2.3.20/LICENSE23.TXT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to the license, it is 2024. But Product status is EOL.
Are there license issues for commercial use?&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for this is most likely some change in how the communication between MaxScale 2.2 and &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-105/"&gt;MariaDB 10.5&lt;/a&gt; is done which was added or fixed for MaxScale 2.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since MaxScale 2.3 is EOL as well (as of January 2022), I'd recommend using a newer version of MaxScale, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
