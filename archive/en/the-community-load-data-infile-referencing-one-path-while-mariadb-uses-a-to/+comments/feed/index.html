&lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/load-data-infile/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/load-data-infile/&lt;/a&gt;
one can see that LOAD DATA INFILE is followed by a 'file_name', 
so this further proves my observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mariadb sets the data path in my.ini (in windows), so when you enter the argument to INFILE, it is looking for a file name located in the folder the data path is set to. That's why I was losing my backslashes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. put the data file into the data folder.
2. use the data file name alone as argument to the INFILE keyword. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to mark this question  "answered"?&lt;/p&gt;
