&lt;p&gt;Virtual box does not do a real flush by default. I will do some testing on this next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

the first place, not try to work around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing should not have to happen no matter how systems crash. But
you need to configure your setup (virtualisation software + host disk system)
so that when InnoDB does fsync(), it really gets to the disk and does not lie
to InnoDB about it. If you've done that and still get this, it would indicate
a bug in InnoDB I think that should be fixed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note this is from the orig MySql server)&lt;/p&gt;

InnoDB: You may have to recover from a backup.
InnoDB: It is also possible that your operating
InnoDB: system has corrupted its own file cache
InnoDB: and rebooting your computer removes the
InnoDB: error.
InnoDB: If the corrupt page is an index page
InnoDB: you can also try to fix the corruption
InnoDB: by dumping, dropping, and reimporting
InnoDB: the corrupt table. You can use CHECK
InnoDB: TABLE to scan your table for corruption.
InnoDB: See also &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/forcing-innodb-recovery.html"&gt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/forcing-innodb-recovery.html&lt;/a&gt;
InnoDB: about forcing recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is all running on a VirtualBox virtual machine with virtual disk. This is the production configuration, not just for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to recover I restart with recover level =4, dump the tables, delete the innodb files, restart with recover = 0 and restore the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my options would be to write a program which detects the situation and does the above procedure automatically!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I am trying to achieve a better long term solution with Maria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InnoDB recovery should always work, even if mysqld or server crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have hard drive caches configured correctly so that when the
drive tells the kernel that a write is done, the data is really on the disk
and not just in internal disk cache. InnoDB recovery is dependent on this.&lt;/p&gt;

When the server starts and hangs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, this "can be interupted abruptly, leaving the InnoDB tables blocked" surely looks like a bug. I'd suggest you to report it on bugs.mysql.com and see if it gets fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
