You'll need to create a file, for example, "commands.sql" containing all the SQL instructions. Then, if you're logged into the mysql client, run "source commands.sql". Or, if you're not logged in, pass commands.sql from the command line. As long as commands.sql contains all the SQL commands you want, there's just one instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, I want to do this. But this file has to be executed by the MySQL command client (in a logged in session). So, how do you execute a file containing many commands from the MySQL client?&lt;/p&gt;
