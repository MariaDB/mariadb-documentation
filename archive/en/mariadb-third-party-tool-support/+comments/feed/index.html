You will have full support for MONyog and SQLyog and there is no need to purchase any additional contract. -- Chris (MariaDB)&lt;/p&gt;

I am from Webyog and can assure you that we here provide support for SQLyog or MONyog. You do not need to purchase separate support package from Webyog if you have purchased the package support package from MariaDB corporation.
