It should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to your situation is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;start a 10.1.x server on your data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;let it cleanly shutdown, and then
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;migrate to 10.3 (or later)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The server needs to be cleanly shut down, as while data files are usually compatible between versions, the redo logs may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of a useful way to read the undo logs, as these are binary files intended for use by InnoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

we see error [ERROR] InnoDB: Upgrade after a crash is not supported. This redo log was created before 10.2.2?&lt;/p&gt;
