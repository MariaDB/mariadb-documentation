I didn't install Maxscale, but do plan to work with it in the future. But I was able to complete the upgrade.  I'll be looking at replication manager as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Install Maxscale
2 Change your application to connect to Maxscale Route all traffic to Master 
3 Start the replication in mode GTID 
4 Upgrade your Slaves 
4 Install replication-manager &lt;a href="https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/replication-manager"&gt;https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/replication-manager&lt;/a&gt;
5 Do Master Election aka switchover
6 Upgrade the old master &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be done with 0 downtime &lt;/p&gt;
