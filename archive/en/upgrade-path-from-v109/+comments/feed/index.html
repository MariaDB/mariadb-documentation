&lt;p&gt;I might missed the point but we don't ship MCS with a forked MDB anymore. All future releases including 1.5 are shipped as MDB plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking you don't need incremental upgrades but you need to move your data manually though b/c all releases older 1.4 have their data under /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/data whilst releases younger than 1.4 under /var/lib/columnstore.
Save dbroot data, remove old packages, install new packages, stop MCS, copy in data, start MCS. This path doesn't allow S3 transition though.
I belive there will be at least an 1.2 -&amp;gt; 1.5 upgrade doc available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with 1.5 community version plugin will install a single-node MCS. To have a multi-node cluster you need a separate package that controlls the cluster that is available for MariaDB customers only at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think you can get 1.4 unless you are MariaDB customer I believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest you to ask future questions in our google group.&lt;/p&gt;
