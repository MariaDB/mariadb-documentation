I am a student of PSIT, Kanpur and I have experience in C and Java and Oracle database. How can I further apply for it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am Kapil Chhajer student from IIIT Hyderabad pursuing  M.tech. CSE. I  am comfortable with c, c++ and java.  From Database perspective , I  developed Simple Database engine in java as academic project. I am gone through project list. I found out   "UDFs returning arrays" as interesting one but I am not getting completely. 
Please explain it or give me some related material link so I can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

One can &lt;strong&gt;already&lt;/strong&gt; enjoy all the above by using pam_ldap.so module and the MariaDB PAM authentication plugin. MariaDB works with LDAP just fine already (via pam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is what benefits does a separate LDAP authentication plugin offers. Why users might want to use an an LDAP authentication plugin over the combination of pam_ldap.so and PAM authentication plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

For example most large organisations keep information about their workers in a directory service on the servers. Rather that creating users tables to hold this info in mariaDb will take too much time. Managing this table is also a huge task which can also reduce performance due to overpopulation. The ldap plugin will serve as an interface between mariadb and the directory service such that info can be retrieved with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool stuff with ldap is that if a request is made to the directory service and the requested data is not there, a reference to another directory service that contains it is returned. The Ldap plugin if incorporated into mariadb can be used to authenticate users since in runs directly on the TCT/IP stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please write me if you need more explanation that will convince mariadb developpers to include this task at GSoc 2015 maybe a draft proposal.
 Best regards. 
Chick&lt;/p&gt;

I get it, In both cases the users are exposed through NSS.&lt;/p&gt;

For us to accept this project, we need to understand first what this LDAP authentication plugin will do, why our users might want to use it, how it'll be different from using PAM authentication plugin with pam_ldap.so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'd suggest to start from that — from the explanation why users should use the LDAP authentication plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Engineering student from National Institute of Technology, Patna with over 2.7 years of experience in C++, Java and MySQL applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please suggest some suitable links to start in LDAP. Meanwhile I have started investigating into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your suggestions will be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards Rohit.
