Full support needs arrays, and MariaDB does not support arrays yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now we've implemented a non-standard cycle suppression feature: CYCLE ... RESTRICT&lt;/p&gt;

Like belows :
------
WITH T (select * from table1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELECT T1.name , T2.value
FROM T as T1, T as T2
WHERE T1.somevalue = T2.somevalue
-----
I encount an error on "From T as T1, T as T2"
I think alias is not possible for WITH&lt;/p&gt;

Will you support them?&lt;/p&gt;
