Thanks for your reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, Yes. I replaced them. What happened in order from installation....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;1. yum install maria-server maria-client (I created MariaDB.repo file for version)
2. Edited server.cnf file.
[mysqld]
datadir = {new datadir}
innodb_data_home_dir={new innodb_data_home_dir}
innodb_log_group_home_dir={new innodb_log_group_home_dir}
3. cp -R /var/lib/mysql/* /data/{new datadir}
4. mariabackup failed. Then I rollback server.cnf. But mariabackup was still failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;DB server is still in running. 
So I thought it's OK. But, it's not OK now. Because DB backup was failed.
Did I muff it?&lt;/p&gt;

Like replacing them from another instance? This isn't supported and cannot be fixed. Was this a forced install over an previous instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did your mariadb instance end up in this state? It seems like there's a significant back story and the mismatch between idb and ibdata1 seems to be a result of manual intervention. If you have the files from a previous consistent state then that might be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
