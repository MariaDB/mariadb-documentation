This is really misleading in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;mariadb-backup --copy-back --target-dir=2024-08-05-10-22-37
mariadb-backup based on MariaDB server 10.5.22-MariaDB Linux (x86_64)
[00] 2024-08-06 08:15:37 Original data directory /var/lib/mysql is not empty!
&lt;/pre&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bernhard Donaubauer</dc:creator><guid>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/help-me-understand-mariadb-upgrade/+comments/6846</guid></item><item><title>Re: Help me understand  mariadb-upgrade</title><link>https://mariadb.com/kb/en/help-me-understand-mariadb-upgrade/+comments/6845</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this file is missing. I made a test and deleted the whole "datadir" and started MariaDB. The database was initialized from scratch and "mysql_upgrade_info" is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something is wrong with the backup/restore procedure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my backup and restore with mariadb-backup according to this manual &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/incremental-backup-and-restore-with-mariabackup/"&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/incremental-backup-and-restore-with-mariabackup/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the "restore" section there is clearly stated "ensure that the datadir is empty" so I deleted the content of /var/lib/mysql and of course the "mysql_upgrade_info" was deleted too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously "mariadb-backup" did not create this file so either the manual is wrong or some program involved in the restore/startup process should create this  "mysql_upgrade_info" file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://git.almalinux.org/rpms/mariadb/src/branch/a9/SOURCES/mariadb-check-upgrade.sh"&gt;https://git.almalinux.org/rpms/mariadb/src/branch/a9/SOURCES/mariadb-check-upgrade.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relies on the file mysql_upgrade_info in the datadir to identify if an upgrade procedure was performed and if so which version it occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect your database initialization/restore procedure didn't create the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So its just a bit confused by the lack of a file. You can create one to silence the warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;echo 10.5.22-MariaDB &amp;gt; mysql_upgrade_info&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time previous to 10.5.14 (&lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27607"&gt;MDEV-27607&lt;/a&gt;) when an installation didn't provide this upgrade file.&lt;/p&gt;
