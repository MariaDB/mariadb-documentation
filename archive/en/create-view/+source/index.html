CREATE
    [OR REPLACE]
    [ALGORITHM = {UNDEFINED | MERGE | TEMPTABLE}]
    [DEFINER = { user | CURRENT_USER | role | CURRENT_ROLE }]
    [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }]
    VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] view_name [(column_list)]
    AS select_statement
    [WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;toc&gt;&gt;

== Description

The CREATE VIEW statement creates a new [[views|view]], or replaces an existing
one if the OR REPLACE clause is given. If the view does not exist, CREATE OR
REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does exist, CREATE OR
REPLACE VIEW is the same as [[alter-view|ALTER VIEW]].

The select_statement is a [[SELECT]] statement that provides the definition of
the view. (When you select from the view, you select in effect using the SELECT
statement.) select_statement can select from base tables or other views.

The view definition is &#34;frozen&#34; at creation time, so changes to the underlying
tables afterwards do not affect the view definition. For example, if a view is
defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added to the table later do not
become part of the view. A [[show-create-view|SHOW CREATE VIEW]] shows that
such queries are rewritten and column names are included in the view
definition.

The view definition must be a query that does not return errors at view
creation times. However, the base tables used by the views might be altered
later and the query may not be valid anymore. In this case, querying the view
will result in an error. [[check-table|CHECK TABLE]] helps in finding this kind
of problems.

The [[view-algorithms|ALGORITHM clause]] affects how MariaDB processes the
view. The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be
used when checking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK
OPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in tables
referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in this section.

The CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the
view, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT
statement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement you must
have the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you
must also have the DROP privilege for the view.

A view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the
default database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,
specify the name as db_name.view_name when you create it.

&lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;
CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;

Base tables and views share the same namespace within a database, so a
database cannot contain a base table and a view that have the same
name.

Views must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like base
tables. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the SELECT
statement are used for the view column names. To define explicit names
for the view columns, the optional column_list clause can be given as
a list of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in
column_list must be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the
SELECT statement.

&lt;&lt;product mysql to=5.1.28&gt;&gt;
Prior to MySQL 5.1.29, When you modify an existing view, the
current view definition is backed up and saved. It is stored in that
table&#39;s database directory, in a subdirectory named arc. The backup
file for a view v is named v.frm-00001. If you alter the view again,
the next backup is named v.frm-00002. The three latest view backup
definitions are stored. Backed up view definitions are not preserved
by [[mysqldump]], or any other such programs, but you can retain them
using a file copy operation. However, they are not needed for anything
but to provide you with a backup of your previous view definition. It
is safe to remove these backup definitions, but only while mysqld is
not running. If you delete the arc subdirectory or its files while
mysqld is running, you will receive an error the next time you try to
alter the view: 
&lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;MariaDB [test]&gt; ALTER VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t; 
ERROR 6 (HY000): Error on delete of &#39;.\test\arc/v.frm-0004&#39; (Errcode: 2)
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/product&gt;&gt;

Columns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to
table columns. They can also be expressions that use functions,
constant values, operators, and so forth.

Unqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are
interpreted with respect to the default database. A view can refer to
tables or views in other databases by qualifying the table or view
name with the proper database name.

A view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can
refer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and
subqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables. The
following example defines a view that selects two columns from another
table, as well as an expression calculated from those columns:

&lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);

INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);

CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;

SELECT * FROM v;
+------+-------+-------+
| qty  | price | value |
+------+-------+-------+
|    3 |    50 |   150 |
+------+-------+-------+
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;

A view definition is subject to the following restrictions:

* The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM clause.
* The SELECT statement cannot refer to system or user variables.
* Within a stored program, the definition cannot refer to program parameters or local variables.
* The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.
* Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. However, after a view has been created, it is possible to drop a table or view that the definition refers to. In this case, use of the view results in an error. To check a view definition for problems of this kind, use the CHECK TABLE statement.
* The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot create a TEMPORARY view.
* Any tables named in the view definition must exist at definition time.
* You cannot associate a trigger with a view.
* For valid identifiers to use as view names, see [[identifier-names|Identifier Names]].

ORDER BY is allowed in a view definition, but it is ignored if you
select from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.

For other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the
options or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the
effect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a
LIMIT clause, and you select from the view using a statement that has
its own LIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same
principle applies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or
SQL_SMALL_RESULT that follow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such
as INTO, FOR UPDATE, and LOCK IN SHARE MODE.

The PROCEDURE clause cannot be used in a view definition, and it cannot be used if a view is referenced in the FROM clause.

If you create a view and then change the query processing environment
by changing system variables, that may affect the results that you get
from the view:

&lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;
CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT &#39;abc&#39;;

SET sql_mode = &#39;&#39;;

SELECT &#34;mycol&#34; FROM v;
+-------+
| mycol |
+-------+
| mycol | 
+-------+

SET sql_mode = &#39;ANSI_QUOTES&#39;;

SELECT &#34;mycol&#34; FROM v;
+-------+
| mycol |
+-------+
| abc   | 
+-------+
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;

The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MariaDB account to
use when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is
executed that references the view. They were added in MySQL 5.1.2.
The legal SQL SECURITY characteristic values are DEFINER and INVOKER.
These indicate that the required privileges must be held by the user
who defined or invoked the view, respectively. The default SQL
SECURITY value is DEFINER.

If a user value is given for the DEFINER clause, it should be a MariaDB
account in &#39;user_name&#39;@&#39;host_name&#39; format (the same format used in the
GRANT statement). The user_name and host_name values both are
required.  The definer can also be given as CURRENT_USER or
CURRENT_USER(). The default DEFINER value is the user who executes the
CREATE VIEW statement. This is the same as specifying DEFINER =
CURRENT_USER explicitly.

If you specify the DEFINER clause, these rules determine the legal
DEFINER user values:

* If you do not have the [[grant/#super|SUPER]] privilege, or, from MariaDB 10.5.2, the [[grant/#set-user|SET USER]] privilege, the only legal user value is your own account, either specified literally or by using CURRENT_USER. You cannot set the definer to some other account.
* If you have the [[grant/#super|SUPER]] privilege, or, from MariaDB 10.5.2, the [[grant/#set-user|SET USER]] privilege, you can specify any syntactically legal account name. If the account does not actually exist, a warning is generated.
* If the SQL SECURITY value is DEFINER but the definer account does not exist when the view is referenced, an error occurs.

Within a view definition, CURRENT_USER returns the view&#39;s DEFINER
value by default. For views
defined with the SQL SECURITY INVOKER characteristic, CURRENT_USER
returns the account for the view&#39;s invoker. For information about user
auditing within views, see
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/account-activity-auditing.html.

Within a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER
characteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine&#39;s DEFINER value. This
also affects a view defined within such a program, if the view
definition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.

View privileges are checked like this:

* At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator must have privileges for the columns, as described previously. If the definition refers to a stored function, only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The privileges required when the function runs can be checked only as it executes: For different invocations of the function, different execution paths within the function might be taken.
* When a view is referenced, privileges for objects accessed by the view are checked against the privileges held by the view creator or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.
* If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function, privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend on whether the function is defined with a SQL SECURITY characteristic of DEFINER or INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs with the privileges of its creator. If the characteristic is INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the view&#39;s SQL SECURITY characteristic.

Example: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function
might invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view
invokes a stored function f():

&lt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);

Suppose that f() contains a statement such as this:

IF name IS NULL then
  CALL p1();
ELSE
  CALL p2();
END IF;
&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&gt;

The privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be
checked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed
for p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those
privileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess
the privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v
and the function f().

The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to
standard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for
SQL SECURITY INVOKER.

If you invoke a view that was created before MySQL 5.1.2, it is
treated as though it was created with a SQL SECURITY DEFINER clause
and with a DEFINER value that is the same as your account. However,
because the actual definer is unknown, MySQL issues a warning. To make
the warning go away, it is sufficient to re-create the view so that
the view definition includes a DEFINER clause.

The optional ALGORITHM clause is an extension to standard SQL. It
affects how MariaDB processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:
MERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. The default algorithm is UNDEFINED if
no ALGORITHM clause is present. See [[view-algorithms|View Algorithms]] for more information.

Some views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such
as UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying
table. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one
relationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the
underlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a
view non-updatable. See [[inserting-and-updating-with-views|Inserting and Updating with Views]].

=== WITH CHECK OPTION
The WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to
prevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE
clause in the select_statement is true.

In a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and
CASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view
is defined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the
CHECK OPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the
checks for underlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither
keyword is given, the default is CASCADED.

For more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION
clause, see
[[inserting-and-updating-with-views|Inserting and Updating with Views]].

=== IF NOT EXISTS
&lt;&lt;product mariadb from=&#34;10.1.3&#34;&gt;&gt;
The ##IF NOT EXISTS## clause was added in MariaDB 10.1.3
&lt;&lt;/product&gt;&gt;
When the IF NOT EXISTS clause is used, MariaDB will return a warning instead of an error if the specified view already exists. Cannot be used together with the ##OR REPLACE## clause.

=== Atomic DDL
&lt;&lt;product mariadb from=10.6.1&gt;&gt;
MariaDB 10.6.1 supports [[atomic-ddl|Atomic DDL]] and ##CREATE VIEW## is atomic.
&lt;&lt;/product&gt;&gt;

== Examples

&lt;&lt;sql&gt;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;

INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,1), (2,2), (3,3);

CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT a, a*2 AS a2 FROM t;

SELECT * FROM v;
+------+------+
| a    | a2   |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    4 |
|    3 |    6 |
+------+------+
&lt;&lt;/sql&gt;&gt;

OR REPLACE and IF NOT EXISTS:
&lt;&lt;sql&gt;&gt;
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT a, a*2 AS a2 FROM t;
ERROR 1050 (42S01): Table &#39;v&#39; already exists

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v AS SELECT a, a*2 AS a2 FROM t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS v AS SELECT a, a*2 AS a2 FROM t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

SHOW WARNINGS;
