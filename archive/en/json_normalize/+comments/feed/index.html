Chime in if you'd use it &lt;a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27651"&gt;https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27651&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you use `PERSISTENT` (or equivalently, `STORED`) instead, then the `jnorm` column will actually be stored in the db, but so too will the `val` column, doubling the storage used. Currently, having `BEFORE INSERT` and `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers with `SET NEW.val = JSON_NORMALIZE(NEW.val)` is the only way to do what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

And the normalize function is run each time there's a SELECT jnorm? That seems like quite a hit when dealing with large JSON documents (the column is LONGTEXT after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope was to be able to normalize the data between INSERT and actually writing to disk, to remove whitespace and help optimize any functions that run on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is easily done on a front end, but if there's already a good JSON_NORMALIZE in MDB, why not let it be used for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

E.g. column argument `ON UPDATE JSON_NORMALIZE`? This could be an easy way to save about 20%+ on storage, and likely also have some performance benefits for read-heavy applications.&lt;/p&gt;
