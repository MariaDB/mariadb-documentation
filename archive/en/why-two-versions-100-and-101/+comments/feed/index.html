&lt;p&gt;I would like to add on top of Daniel answer:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; - Increasing major release cycle period, is giving MariaDB captains and external contributors closer windows of time for modifying system objects that are needed by a new feature. That's a trade off between accepting more code changes vs the time users spend in upgrading. In any open source project your time is an important contribution to the product by exposing new code to a wider community.           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Regarding the upgrade procedure, captains are always fixing bugs regarding compatibility issues with older versions of system tables, engine formats and protocols, but in some cases new or existing features can be broken if the code don't found the expected version of protocols and objects. I can quote a case where the performance was really impacted on VIEWS keeping the older version of the object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still skip the upgrade at your own risk, the best advice in this case is good tracking of the error log.  Compatibility issues should be trigger in this log if they are required or advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As binary compatibility can't be 100% guaranty it's always suggest to apply the mysql_upgrade process and reloading your data from a dump. We don't give up on keeping that process more simple, 10.1 have an interesting feature that can make this it more easy in the future see &lt;a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-4262"&gt;https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-4262&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. There was in underlying codebase that changes significantly and could of generated regressions for minor upgrades. This is avoided in the development process. Stable versions get bug fixes and minor features that have low risk impacts on the code base. Development versions get new major features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; is it going to be another whole new release with separate upgrade/versioning paths? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.X are going to be new major version and version path. Upgrade documentation will be created like &lt;a href="/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-100-to-101/"&gt;upgrading-from-mariadb-100-to-101&lt;/a&gt;. Upgrading is a relatively painless however testing is required to ensure queries are fast and you aren't using deprecated features (rare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely from a development management perspective this creates resource overheads for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously yes, but its needed to deliver stable releases and introduce new features/functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will v10.0 cease development in the near future, to be replaced by v10.1? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect its got a date where development will slow on it and it would be good to know when this is and what is the official status of 5.1, 5.3 and 5.5 as no official end of life notice has been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am trying to decide whether I just should upgrade our systems to v10.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a incremental upgrade of systems to 10.1 would be recommended and deploy new systems on 10.1 to minimize migration effort in the future. Upgrades are currently only supported between 1 major version so 10.0 to 10.2 isn't guaranteed to be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
