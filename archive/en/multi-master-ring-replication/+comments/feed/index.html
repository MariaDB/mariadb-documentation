&lt;p&gt;It is not clear.
It would be nice to have a page with commands to type.
e.g.
Ensure that the slave is up to date (has digested all relay events).=&amp;gt; How?
You can now treat the slave as a new master and put it back in the replication ring. The new master will use its replication GTID position to continue replication from the other master in the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the limitations is "Ensure that UPDATE and DELETE on each master only update rows generated by this master."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="anchored_heading" id="seems-it-works-even-if-a-row-can-be-updated-on-both-sites-i-agree-some-updates-can-be-lost-in-case-of-desynchronization-but-in-some-case-it-is-not-an-issue"&gt;&amp;gt; Seems it works even if a row can be updated on both sites. I agree some updates can be lost in case of desynchronization, but in some case it is not an issue.&lt;/h1&gt;
