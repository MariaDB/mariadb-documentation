&lt;p&gt;If you are on UNIX or Linux, I suggest you type "man 3 printf" at a command prompt. that will show (in part): "The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is indeed a printf(3) format string, "%s" would mean that a corresponding argument to printf(3) is to be interpreted as a character array, and the "%d" would mean that the corresponding argument is interpreted as a decimal number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the function call might look something like this: "printf('%s, %d', databasename, #ENOENT)". There is a list of common error codes in /usr/include/sys/errno.h .&lt;/p&gt;
